8,555666,it is happening in my country  india  we closed the economy for three months and everything crashed  people are losing their jobs  suicide rate is now even higher  homeless people are dying on the streets  migrant workers are stuck in other states without getting any income  and they have all gone hungry  it is a bad idea to close down a country  more people will die  and that will not be because of the virus  it will be because the country is closed  even though we have a messed up prime minister  now we are slowly regaining our strength as a country  the economy is slowly getting healed up since we started opening the country again  thorough testing have been done and cases have also gone up but more care have also been provided  and many have also developed immunity towards the virus  if you don t believe me you can fact check yourself   but i don t care  your country is not my country  things may work differently over there than here  but i just want to clarify that what trump said   closing down the country is not good   is right  you will all suffer more if you close down your country  and there will be a great threat to your social security if your country weakens economically  your enemies will take advantage of that,0

40,Aidenheeth,the minimum wage in my state for adults over 25      20 god bless australia   thats for working at macdonalds  kmart or any other regular job if youre in sales  its  25  a nurse  27    40   first responders  who risk their fuckin life  deserve more than  15  no wonder less and less people are joining  madness  as a foreigner these debates have proved to be extremely entertaining  it helps me realize how those who ve gained a position in politics  and you can infer the same to anyone in a position of leadership   have the emotional maturity of a child  i see this in my local countries  question time  which is a program which films the discussions had in australian parliament  it d be nice if both sides of the political debate  left vs right  republican vs democrat  labor vs liveral  met in the center and discussed issues as a team  working for its citizens  instead of children debating over how their opponent is wrong  creating straw man arguments which lead to no resolution   thank you for the circus  which is what american politics seems to outsiders  every year i tune in to see how much crazier itll be this season  it never fails to disappoint  i thought bush was a laugh but man  this election has been a true riot  keep on bickering  its really helping resolve the issues which have been ongoing problems since the dawn of civilization or mankind  if a business dies  it can be rebuilt  so long as the demand for the service it produces remains    when people die  except in one case  they generally stay that way  people are the driving factor of any modern workforce  valuing lives first is logical when managing the economy  im no economist  or running a business  if your workers are sick  or dead  the businesses will cease  i get the concern republicans have about the state of the country thanks to the  1t debt the u s  has but it will be unpayable if practical action isn t followed   whats more valuable  money  which is promisary  based on debt and essentially worthless  only a means to gain wealth  or human life  the driving force behind any business or organisation    i pity those of you voting in this election  you re presented with a shit sandwhich  trump  and  a douchbag  biden   the shit sandwhich seemingly values americas economical success over the lives of its people  also who wont recognize the idealogical problems in the us  with the fear of losing voters and the douchebag  who seems incapable of being strong on hardline idealogies  particularly postmodernism and groups which believe in that  ideology  e g  antifa    i hope to see some unknown independent being elected  but the us  and mine  the australian  government system wont dare move away from a duoply  which doesn t reflect a freedom of speech  you re forced to vote for  keep in mind the terms i m bout to use are exaggerations on each  side  i m not for or against either side  a group of hard arse money grabbing bullies or a group of easily manipulated pussies who will bend to the will of the public zeitgeist  irrelevent of if it s helpful or harmful    if youre a yank  no offense  its just what most aussies call americans  be grateful that you have the choice to vote  in my country once you sign up  which is optional  to vote  you cant sign out  you must vote or are charged a  200    300 fine  god bless and if you read this  thanks for your time,0

151,BrianGraves,with what i have observed in this debate thus far  biden stuttered on numerous responses and did not give viable responses to the majority of the questions asked   nobody mentioned the bill passed earlier this year by democrats to release multiple felons who murdered and raped numerous victims and instead of deporting all these immigrants out of the country  also pertaining to the ones who have been deported already as well  they instead have the american taxpayer purchase a ticket for the deported and bring them back into this country with immunity to numerous future repercussions  all this was done right before the riots all around the country broke out and evidence was even given about government officials being instigators for a lot of the massive rioting that literally spun out of control   i have my doubts on joe biden s ability to effective run his country or make an honest decision for the american people without any chance of profit for him in return   too many questions need to be answered and none have been thus far,0

357,GeronimoStanding,who built the cages joe   game over  face palm,3
358,GhostLoFi,i love how he talks about great doctors great hospitals his health care is probably more expensive than my neighborhood houses he could probably pay off at least a thousand in people s houses for the rest of their lives and then some what i m trying to say is the only reason why he recovered so fast because he has the top doctors in the world taking care of him  most people are dying alone and a hospital room because there s not enough doctors to take care of them all he was lying about the young people s immune system my friend and i were in class together we are only 16 and he caught the virus and it made him extremely ill we were all exposed to it likely i tested negative but he unfortunately didn t he s sick  and he s a relatively healthy human,10
359,GizmogwiTrueWitt,most important comment in the debate was biden mentioning how much time we have to deal with climate change  if you have children you care about pay attention  all trump could respond is he s saving the economy  what economy  you won t have an economy without a planet,9

361,Gohskull,why aren t you talking about the biden s criminality,29
362,GoodNewsJim,i love the environment   the problem is that the kids that grow up on captain planet also grow up on spongebob   they don t understand that sometimes causing massive amounts of economic loss is worse from the environment than having some industry   if you ban oil  the environment will actually be worse because the poverty short term solutions hurt the environment worse  lets ban oil  lets ban the police  lets ban metal  we can make solar powered battleships out of balsa wood  why do people get on trump s case for border security  these problems have been on every president s term  but now we focus on it as if it is trump specific  nah  every pres had these issues  racism was such a huger problem in the early 80s   after michael jackson and the cosby show  people started talking about how racism is wrong   i know 500ish people 499 are not racist   and the one who is  we have intervention talks when he speaks wrong   but if the news makes you think racism worse than ever and everyone is a hater  then you believe their lies   most people are cool and loving   cnn led by the democrats know what they are doing   cnn caused the race riots on purpose as a plot because they knew if they rubbed our faces in hate long enough  we d hate back   it is clear now that joe biden caused the race riots  https   www youtube com watch v cgkl7pyn2km,0

462,Joe,this moderator was smarter and calmer than the first one but still biased to biden  whenever trump attack biden she always ask biden if he want to response back but when biden attack trump she never ask trump if he want to response back  he always have to interfere to defend himself and she tell him to response fast because she have another question  this way trump will look like he was being rude  also she never questioned biden on his statements but she always did with trump,0

504,JustinWahl,biden is so full of paradoxes   he is going to solve global warming  within the next decade  and yet according to kamala harris  they stand  against aoc s green new deal   he would ve prevented the economy from  failing in 2020  and yet he would ve been more aggressive in the  pandemic quarantine measures   he claims to be against locking up drug  users  and yet his vp kamala harris was incredibly aggressive in locking  up marijuana users during her term as california attorney general   he  just employs magical thinking   so many of his actions or proposals are  directly contrary to what he says will happen under his administration,0

572,Legend,i m not seeing where people are getting that joe won  from what i understand  he will indeed raise taxes  use force against people not wearing a mask in a park when there s no one around  however  i didn t like the answer of trump stating that the military will be rolling out vaccinations  that makes me think that the vaccine will in fact be mandatory  all and all  i m not happy with either outcome  i lean more towards trump based on this debate  he wasn t wrong about the blue states  they are crumbling and they are in bad shape  also  the fact that biden says that he doesn t have to give voters the answer to whether or not he s going to pack the court  personally  based on the democratic record specifically over the past few months  i really don t want a democratic court to rule this country  that s all i have to say about that  i m not saying i m voting trump or biden  i m just concerned about america and everyone who lives here  we all need to put this racism and bigotry aside  and unite like the americans we re supposed to strive to be  we all bleed the same blood when it comes down to it so why all of the aggression towards each other  when i see people killing each other based on the color of their skin alone  it s pitiful that we could stoop that low as a civilization  this needs to stop in order to move forward as the human race or we will divide and crumble into a shadow of what our society could have become as the last human in earth has the last thought of  why did it come to this  this is where we re heading  democrat  republican  it doesn t matter in the end when all our struggles were for not  the founding fathers of this country would be ashamed that we were making so much progress  only to back pedal our way to 50 years ago as racism  misogyny and misandry  and class warfare continues to become a bigger and bigger problem to the point where eventually we won t be able to communicate with each other  or accept each other for who we are  that s all i have to say about that,0

581,LibSerum,when watching cnn discussing political stories  watch how often they will reference  unnamed sources  or  unanimous sources   once you notice how frequently they come up  you ll understand why clown news network is so disrespected nationally  we see no evidence the count was legitimate because it was hidden  were they hiding their honesty    yes  there is credible evidence being discovered   wait and see  and by the way if by some  mathematically miraculous harris biden were to legitimately win  then congrats and see you in 2022,0

658,MikeRivas,1 08 30 trump  i ve prepaid millions upon millions of dollars  i prepaid my taxes  it s called prepaying taxes  it s worst than paying taxes     so  here s an example of prepaying  when you buy a home and keep an escrow account for taxes and insurance you re prepaying taxes  if you ve paid more than your fair share when those taxes are due you get a nice check in the mailbox  if you ve paid less than your fair share you have to cut the irs a check    it happens skip to 38 30  the first 38 minutes is a waist of time,12
659,MikeSzabo,trump 2020  he has done a lot to help this country if you look into it  the whole covid thing would have been a struggle with any president  the mask doesn t seem to help with the common cold at my work so think it s a waste of time for covid but makes it look like we are trying  president trump has been a good president and can t beat those gas prices for the past 4 years haha,1
660,MinMin,some chinese netizens watched the popular video of president trump going along the streets in ohio and said   why are the roads so broken   many cities in the united states do lack infrastructure  the leftist democrats and republican establishments waste money in three areas  1 spread money and high welfare  obama has been in power for eight years  and the number of welfare recipients has increased to 50 million  an average of one in every six americans   welfare   if the government wants to spend a lot of money  people will naturally take advantage of the loopholes  2  foreign aid will spend a lot of money  the annual foreign aid of the united states is astronomical  obama gave pakistan 1 billion u s  dollars  where bin laden was harboured   and returned palestine with 70 million u s  dollars when he left office  hamas bought grenade to attack israel   3  spend 50 billion in afghanistan every year  it has been 19 years since the afghan war  why does the united states have to contract the roads  bridges and economy of this country  so trump is completely right to withdraw his troops   only if trump is re elected will he continue to change these  writer  cao changqing,1

667,MotivatedMatthew,taxes are still old school  taxes used to be used to make the king rich   taxes should be used not to pay politicians until they are filthy rich  they should be going to medical help and education and things that keep americans alive and progressing   i should also be able to pick what my taxes go to  like a checklist every year when i do them   if something goes under that taxes pay then it isnt important to americans   i dont like giving money and people do dumb shit with it or pay a corrupt politician  meanwhile  i can go to jail if im not paying them,0

673,MrMe,the whole debate former vice president biden was some perilous weatherman churning out stats for who was or wasnt  going to make it another year and it really came off as sad and desperate   when you see movies which depict america as some desolate wasteland  you wonder how that could happen  it makes you think of the unleashed villains allowed to destroy entire cities and parts of states under the banner of false narratives    why would anyone continue to partner with the insane to enact more fantasy league laws and premises with the end goal of attempting to dupe is out of our freedom,0

762,RONJAGRAFX,now hear this    it looks like the 2020 presidential election is over despite whatever the president is tweeting this sunday morning      we would like to draw everybody s attention to author ron brownstein s article in the recent atlantic magazine where he postulates that american voters have evolved down different fault lines in recent elections    there seems to be two major categories which meaningfully replace our old red vs blue and traditional  republican vs democrat   those who support the current president are members of a coalition of restoration who feel the need to roll back the laws regarding women s health  lgbt   q rights  voting rights and health care    opposing these people  regardless of geographic location  are members of the 21st century version of a coalition of transformation which recognizes a new age of acceptance of minorities  the rights of the citizenry  and  although minimally mentioned  are profoundly anti fascist    brownstein points out that what we are beginning to recognize is that it is that the set of goals of the coalition of restoration begins to look pretty ridiculous when oshkosh  wisconsin is telling ocean beach  california what to do    however   the typology readily explains the reason s  why the american right is willing to put up with liars like  kayleighmendasity   phony television economists like larry kudlow and daffy peter navarro  tea party rejects like mark matthews  and straight up threats to public health and well being the likes of  doctor  scott atlas    its no accident that the latest maps of expansion of covid 19 are in the jurisdictions who supported trump  those jurisdictions contribution only 30 to 33  to gross domestic product of the us    we wake up sunday to the same lies coming out of the white house and the same group of supporters lending hand  aid and comfort to ostensible fascists,0

855,SheerCrowd,99 9  of young people recover   99  of all patients recover  i m really  really baffled he can say that when i ve lost both grandparents  my mother  great uncle  22 year old cousin  her 22 year old boyfriend  great uncle s 13 year old son  and my father is lying  practically on his deathbed in the hospital where i can t even see him suffer  it s really  really baffling  of the friends and family i have  i know over 10 people who have contracted the virus and over half have died  my grandfather was a republican and trump supporter  and  in his words  loved the strength and courage trump displays by confronting the virus head on with no mask  he wore no mask when he went out  he got angry at clerks  grocery store workers  got denied from places  and he came home to the house i bought him with a terrible cough  my grandmother was a moderate  and wore a mask because science encouraged it  she was tested often as she had respiratory diseases  mainly asthma and heart problems  when she came down with the virus  she died weeks later in the hospital  how do you think she got it  from my grandfather  he got himself tested a few days after my grandmother was confirmed to have the virus and apparently had also caught it  weeks after my grandmother died  my grandfather died as well   my cousins  13 years old and 22 years old  as well as my older cousin s boyfriend  all caught the disease and died  my little cousin  13 years old  was a fan of baseball and track  he was in shape and ran often  extremely mature for his age and an amazing kid  he is too young to understand politics however  but can understand numbers and statistics to the point that he knows that masks saves lives  being popular  he would go out with friends to eat  wearing a mask  sadly  one of his friends had contracted the virus from his family  and while eating his mask was off and he contracted the virus from his friend  the friend recovered as the symptoms were mild  but my cousin developed severe pneumonia and died in the hospital  my older cousin and her boyfriend have differing political views  her boyfriend was closer to moderate right  trump supporter  but very open minded unlike my grandfather  my cousin was a pure moderate  thinking that both candidates are bad and basing her vote off mostly character and less policy  she had voted for biden  her boyfriend was lucky and still had his job  he worked as a grocery store clerk  and with store policy forcing him to wear a mask  i heard from my cousin that he would often take it off while working when no one is watching  eventually  he came down with the virus and my girlfriend caught it from him as they live in the same apartment  the boyfriend died the day before my older cousin   i can go on and on  i hope you guys in the comments can see the point of view of an american living in this hell  i m neither right nor left  i support neither  i can t even vote as i am a permanent resident  not a us citizen  but i keep up to date with the comings and goings of this country as it affects me and my family  science encourages me to stay indoors unless necessary to go out  and so i do  my girlfriend and i never go out unless we need groceries  or need to run errands at the bank or other places  we always wear a mask when we go out and often wash our hands and use hand sanitizer   we have not caught the coronavirus   use your brain people  do your own research  don t just listen to the candidates  listen to the people around them  listen to cnn and fox and nytimes and nowthis news and vox and whoever the fuck  listen to everything and absorb it  then make your decision  this election can honestly be said to be the most influential election of modern history  don t vote  vote smart,3

1200,webmediafactors4,2 months ago 1 35 were dying  today 1 38 are dying  before taking the victory lap  consider that s exactly what you would see with a  herd immunity  strategy  in other words  with herd immunity  you see the elements of a population susceptible to any contagion die off and proportions of deaths to infections go down  but rate of infection stay the same  as far as i can see  rate of infection is the same which means the only reason we are seeing an improvement of numbers is because the people who will die from the initial strain have died  when they tell us more about how reinfection works  then we can start thinking about victory  right now  it still looks like everyone who escaped this round could die in the next round or the next round or the next round    like a flu that kills 3  of your population every year  for anyone who isn t familiar with how christian business practices work  its fairly standard to give 10  to the church or parish  i m not saying that s what any of the  to the big guy  stuff is  but consider that someone might only see what they can see and not ever see the hidden things that only the initiated understand  trump closed down the  ports  to and from china  but allowed infected elites back in the country  they were in quarantine off shore and he and his administration overruled the quarantine  america is a hub of innovators  off the top of my head  it makes sense to me that you create a floor ventilation system that pulls the virus using technology  for example  maybe there is an ionization field that can attract the virus downward with gravity into a filter instead of it being pulled up into the air  who knows  point is the solution is innovation  you hunker down with what you have and then innovate and emerge  99  of people do not recover  but when you are dealing with statistical significance whats a couple hundred dead people   sarcasm  biden called certain criminals from the streets super predators  because trump has racial bias  he immediately associates criminals from the streets with black people   hence in his mind  biden called black people super predators when he actually called psychopathic criminals super predators,0

1658,RonbisonRachel,how much taxes did you report  joe biden   i ve seen vice president biden saying he never talked to hunter about his business  i ve seen firsthand that that s not true  because it wasn t just hunter s business  they said they were putting the biden family name and its legacy on the line   bobulinski said    the biden family aggressively leveraged the biden family name to make millions of dollars from foreign entities even though some were from communist controlled china   he added   bobulinksi also said that he believes that the chinese involvement in the deal was  political or influence investment  on their part  and that  hunter wanted to use the company as his personal piggy bank by just taking money out of it as soon as it came from the chinese,0

1668,RobertHaskell,i have found that i can take any video of trump  put it on frame advance  and i will see the most exaggerated and clownish expressions ever  to think that his rubbery and extreme facial freakshow is constant makes me wonder how and why  has he practiced in front of a mirror  or is it just in the nature of being such a flagrant liar to also have the face lie    as if one had to overcompensate with facial expressions the falsehoods being emitted by the mouth,0

1670,RobertArmstrongSr,god bless america    lololol,0
1671,RoanWallerius,this looks more like an snl skit then an actual debate,1
1672,RoadRunner,this is just insulting  trump constantly interrupting like a child  and biden literally accusing trump of being responsible for 200 000 covid deaths  he worded it  killing 200 000 people   i hope some of you read this  i have a simple theory and idea  i could be wrong  but i think it s the core problem with the debates    the reason presidential debates have been so toxic for so long  this being the worst one yet  is they do not follow a proper debate format  people can t even learn anything from watching this  this is why half the american people actually have no idea what they re even arguing about   besides the fact that they both just slander each other and use buzzwords   a debate format would fix this so much  they have multiple debates  so it would work perfectly  it s based off a format i used in college on the debate team   1  one major topic is chosen on which the candidates disagree  it could even be voted on by the american people    if the presidential candidates sidetrack completely from this topic  it s entirely their fault at this point  and will look extremely bad on them   2  one person is automatically the  affirmative  and one is the  negative  as naturally one always supports something and the other disagrees    3  the debate order happens  this is where the debate you see on this recording fall apart  a  the affirmative speaks for about 4 minutes  providing any facts and points he would like to  whether they are refuting the other candidate  or supporting his own claim  during this time  the person not speaking will be taking notes  getting ready for a questioning period   seriously  these guys don t even listen to each other  taking notes on what their opponents say to prepare for the next step would force them to    b  cross examination  the candidate who did not speak  the negative in this example  should have taken notes  he will stand  and get a period of time to ask the affirmative several questions  these are questions based directly off things the affirmative has said  such as  how many jobs did you say you brought to america since your presidency began   or even things like  in what ways do you think obamacare failed to provide good healthcare  since you say it has failed so miserably   as the affirmative answers  negative again takes notes  preparing his case   c  the negative stands  makes his case on why he is right  and refutes his opponents arguments  often calling back to his opponents answers during cross ex  he will refute the opponents arguments and answers during cross ex with simple logic  facts that directly refute the argument  or even appeals to authority or emotion in some cases  while he is speaking  the aff will be doing what the neg was doing  taking notes  preparing for cross examination  aka the questioning period   d  at this point  the roles have switched  aff will question the neg  then refute his arguments  and at the end of the debate  both candidates summarize why they are right  any arguments their opponent failed to refute  and may not bring up any new information    this would in summary be one debate  the next debate would be a different topic  seriously guys  go look up debate formats  and even watch some students and professors have them  they re so much more organized,32
1673,RitaMalik,i like biden s smile  trump us pouting like a big fat baby   that stuck has covid now and doesn t know it  we all know ow  i was hoping he would get it so he would have more compassion and    he gets a really mild form  he will use this mild form as his idea of what covid dose  this is not good for him to have caught a very mild form so nope  no compassion on its way  not wishing him death or anything  but atleast a covid that would have given him atleast that gave him empathy,46

1678,RhondaGoss,samuel l  jackson should have been the moderator,755
1679,ReynaldoLira,in this debate  joe biden lied about his son and his own taxes  joe biden also said to force people to work for nothing  by not mentioning a valid wage  if joe biden was vice president before why did he not fix the country then  it is true the obama affordable care act is expensive and denies many people beyond numbers  it s for the select privileged  the democrats are associated with what s called the silent war  mail in ballots can be filled by anyone and fraudulently associated by many unknown factorable groups at play to win the election  we need fingerprint proof elections available by phone to recognized by a central intelligence data base  you could vote from your chair  your own couch by fingerprint  joe biden talks about forcing the economy to boom without letting the american people recover correctly under their own terms and understanding  i am nobody s bitch  nor am i a slave that works for free or to be brainwashed by wonderful words that indicate manipulation rather than the truth  let s look at hillary plans for open borders  do think its ok for your mother or sister or daughter or fellow woman to be abused by other men without respect to law to make their own laws while in our country  where s the safety of the nation called america by we the people  many americans are afraid to speak or to talk due to the power available to our select officials in office  my respects that joe biden is for the democrats  he also played a role with pelosi on a coverup scheme to not let president trump fix the nation freely and enhance the knowledge for the american people  to my understanding by the way joe biden passively speaks and associated attacks are premeditated planning on how to counter president trump  joe biden plays the blame game very well in this debate  joe biden answers vaguely to questions  president trump is correct  how can the american public get help without the correct knowledge  that makes a true argument  joe biden plays the blame game by insulting president trump as if president trump has a scientist degree  doctoral in surgical degree  or as a biomedical doctor degree  president trump saved the nation by closing early and responding to a unknown bio silent war catalyst form that came unknown to us all in america  joe biden the reason he chose kamala harris is to empower votes by the blacks  let s get real about the problem in america  woman are mad because an average man in america can no longer support his family as a household  there is no racial platforms in america  its a front used by democrats  i for once as an american like to here the democrats say minimum wage is to be 20 dollars an hour  look at homes over priced and vehicles over priced  many americans are just a number or for that matter  we the people are modern age slaves  just so you know the young generation  is at a breaking point for civil war for low wages  president trump is fighting for we the people  and donald trump needs the support from every american available  i say this because from the bottom of my heart our military and everyone who serves i knee before them for taking care of my family  donald trump our president deserves to run four years respectively without insults that clash and separate people on the real and righteous thoughts  president trump deserves to run four years advancing america before we become communist and a new third world country  i can only say no one as we the people should be forced under low wages to be slaves under joe biden s ideas  donald trump our president needs all americans to stop acting childish  do it for the sake of our families  our nation  for the ones you care about as neighbors who may not be perfect  who deserve to live another day  our president needs the empowered force of we the people to make a stand  feed a police officer  bless a police officer  bless any one in the military  even we must help one and another to bring our country back to its former glory with respect and honor  i am a young man who sees where we are headed  its not a nice road  you think the coronavirus is bad  what if war wages  do you really think passive talking will protect your american families  no  it will not  we as the people of america need the truth  in my honest opinion trump respects the black communities and serves in a way that he wants to hear the voices across the country any way you express it  donald trump our president also needs to know what we want regardless of the approach  donald trump wants to hear the american public peacefully in order to respond respectively  donald trump our president is fighting for us all  i must admit our president can not do it alone  i write this message from my view  regardless of race as a front  woman want a man who is responsible in the household by reaching the ability to pay the bills and further educate himself to a better role in life  every american deserves a better role in life  we as the people need to wake up  george washington had all races back him up in the civil war for a good cause  why not now  what are we waiting for  for another country to bend us over and stick it to us  we are talking and joking around with our younger generations future  i know my message is to upfront  i apologize  i want you to know the truth  we really need more scientist  bioengineers  doctors  technology advancements  not building to slave people to a rat raced world  wake up american people  please  let donald trump our president do his job,0

1748,NukSuKow,great performance by the president stopping biden in his track of lies  biden looking to chris wallace for help all along waiting for him to step in and help every step of the way,1
1749,NorvelCurtis,interesting    bidon is taking a bashing from trump and makes a very clear point explaining his feelings on racism a nd more importantly  he shows a genuine understanding of the problem and the effects is has on people   he says that most people don t want to hurt people and we need to help improve awareness so people understand what is hurtful to other people   if we can stop hurting each other  we can start toward healing   that sounded reasonable to me   that seemed to fire trump up   i noticed he doubled up on the attacks   trump says he isn t racist  yet he can be vicious toward some of the things that people of color are upset about   he talked about antifa and black lives matter in ways that show he really has a weak understanding of what they are about   he sees the violence in the cities and sympathizes with police being hurt   what he doesn t see is the frustration that people feel about people of color being shot dead in the street at a shockingly high rate   unarmed people   police dept  see it   local governments see it   the federal government sees it   it s a sensitive issue in this country with two sides two it that trump has only been able to see one way   he doesn t see what bidon just touched on and that is that most people don t want to hurt others  they need to be made aware of what is hurtful to others and that there is a difference in the world as seen by people of different colors and it effects a person s self esteem and a person becomes racist in appearance by there reaction to what they experience   trump is in a position of authority and feels pressed to do something so he s standing up to what he sees as violence in the streets   what he doesn t see or understand is that protests are occuring because of police excessive force and the police are responding with excessive force   in all this time  he hasn t even started to have a clue what is going on and will only make things worse until he can see this from another angle   he needs to listen   when people protest  they want to be understood   if he were to listen and understand  they could begin healing and learning about each other   trump uses terms like  law and order  and  terrorists  but nothing about equality    the american bill of rights that apply to all citizens were initially meant for all white men who owned land   they have been amended to include all people  both men and women of all races   it took a couple hundred years to get to this place of equality and during that time  a lot of adjustments had to be made in society   equal in the eyes of the law didn t extend to equality in the eyes of the soul and the person   society in america was established to serve white people by white people who saw others as anything but people   when you follow the historical evolution of american society  it s clear that we developed into a society of many smaller and diverse societies that grew further apart rather than merge together   this led to people joining forces to protect themselves from the ever growing threats they faced by the gradual loss of the control they once felt comfortable having   there were elements among all groups that sought to bring people together and there were those who sought to exploit the strengths that these groups would form   fear became the principle method of doing this   create enough fear between diverse groups and they will be on the defense and will remain segregated   teach them enough about each other to make them want to remain apart   it isn t fully known who  what or why things went this way  but our history confirms it   when we see racial outrage and hatred displayed openly  what we see are expressions from people who are feeling pressured by society to resist that which they have been taught to be afraid of  that they must defend themselves against   trump has absolutely zero experience understanding the feelings of other races and only knows that things work as long as they don t threaten the world as he understands it   he also has no tollarence for disruption of the norm and finds doubt in the concept of protest because he has never felt what it feels like to be denied anything   he doesn t hate people of color   he doesn t see color   he also doesn t realize how much not seeing color makes him seem racist   anyway  just a few things to consider,0

2175,DrewXavier,i m surprised by the fact that most people seem to blame both parties for the lack of decor  biden tried his best to be a statesman but trump continously interrupted him and the moderator  if biden had kept quiet than the same people would have said biden was weak   let s call it what it is trump actions were intentional and he praised a racist group and told them to stand back and stand by  is he their de facto leader  why is no one outraged and alarmed by that comment   also  i pay a large amount in taxes every year but the person who is the current president and supposedly a billionaire stated it is smart to find a way to manipulate the tax system so you don t have to pay your fair share  enough is enough  stop looking at trump with rose colored glasses and see that he is a person of chaos in divisiveness  remember we are the united states not the divided states,111

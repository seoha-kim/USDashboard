79	AMIESMITH	it was a wicked act not a mistake  a purposeful act  putting black young men in jail  on immigration  trump must have said obama s admin deported more folks in the history of america than any other admin  in the history of the us america  a lot of folks are clueless about this info  for the records  most weren t criminals  but a guy said that so i must clarify  biden said they ll give people citizenship blah  blah  blah  obama promised that first term and never did  the hispanic weren t pleased that he didn t fulfill his promise as a result  when he met with them  requesting their votes  second term  he couldn t respond  because his hand was held under water  under their admin  that was a broken promise  congress declined my request they ll say but why do you have veto power  no excuses  promise made  promise unkept  why trust them again  if he wins  it ll be obama s 3rd term  he directs biden as to what to do like a trojan horse  no way josea  no biden  under trump admin  promises made  promises kept  trump did 30 things under his admin  in less than 3 years than what they accomplished under 8 years  i wish he went down the list quickly  i have it  was blown away  and have been conveying it  people must trust built record and accomplishments rather than wannabe do s in the mere future  i trust what i see firsthand  not promises to be fulfilled  he was in congress 47 years and should ve assisted obama to do more under 8 years but what did he do  they handed over a good economy  can t take that away from them and trump held on  progressing in that momentum  till china left the door ajar on the world  that s evil personified  why did they not let it go to the other parts of china  they should be brought before the tribunal  again  as it pertains to the china virus  nobody will have been able to control it  once china left the door opened  some of the people that caught it  had left the country and continued to spread it  trump admin  biden says should ve closed one week earlier but then when they did  biden opposed it and stated he was a xenophobic  racist  see the hypocrisy  that s for votes to be taken away from trump  pelosi was dancing in chinatown but now another hypocrite  who didn t have her mask on at the salon  the salon turned her in  how about that  kamala says look at what they brought on us  this current admin didn t  you refuse to hold china accountable but say they brought this on us  that s a lie right there  in order to garner votes  i won t trust them  tulsi gabbard did a tremendous job  opening up her record  she said she ll be a prosecuting president  tulsi said  i m deeply concerned about that  let her record be the proven fact  as a prosecutor  she extended the stay of people  gave them hard labor  placed folks in jail for smoking marijuana but when she was asked  she laughed about it  go figure  she poured cold water on her and she froze  vote red  r remove  e every  d democrat  remove every democrat  remove every dem at a time  drain that swamp mr president  last but not the least  vote for the senators  and house of representatives  they re equally imperative  that s congress  they re the determining factors over everything that passes  it was due to the dem occupying the house of representatives  with the majority  that led them to impeach trump over what wasn t impeachable  just because they demanded his removal  the first day he won the election  had they controlled the senate  they would ve legislated and executed his impeachment  but it was crushed like a tomato  due to the republicans controlled house  being in the majority and the majority carries the vote	1

164	AinzOoalGown	these first responders  we all clap for as they come down the street  because they ve allowed us to make it  what is happening  they deserve a minimum wage of fifteen dollars  anything below that puts you below the poverty level  and there is no evidence that when you raise minimum wage  businesses go out of business    biden 2020  so  first responders deserve minimum wage  or do people working for less than  15 hr just get to live in poverty	0

173	Al	biden struggles too much to find the words he wants to say   it doesn t give one a warm  fuzzy feeling thinking that he could be running the country one day  oh  that s right it the harris biden ticket so kamala would actually be in charge  explain to me why all taxpayers should be bailing out poorly run democrat municipalities and states  funny how the scientists said in 1973 that we were going to run completely out of crude oil within 20 years and here we are burning record numbers of barrels of crude oil with no real end of the supply in sight  except the artificial shortages caused by reducing production  no one even mentions depleting the source anymore  so why should i believe what they are saying about  global warming   there has been a lot of businesses closing their doors because they couldn t afford to pay the artificial wage increases caused by raising the minimum wage  raising the minimum wage has a snowball effect  employers who are forced to pay even more for their laborers  raise their prices accordingly so they can maintain a level of profit that allows them to stay in business and afford the way of life they ve been accustomed to   often  the owners of the businesses  especially the mom and pop places  are barely scraping by themselves  most of their profits are put back into the business  i ve known plenty of business owners who have had to transfer their own funds from the bank account to the business account just so they can make payroll for their employees and pay their vendors for the goods which allow them to stay in business  and yes  it works that way  some make huge profits and then  later  have to return those profits to the business in order to keep it afloat  traffic stops were a bit different when his daughter was growing up  but a father who didn t tell his children how to behave during a traffic stop is a poor father   i was in the military and there were times we  my shipmates and i  had to enter a military base while on a bus  marines  fully armed  would come out and search the under carriage with mirrors and bomb dogs while more marines stood behind a two way mirror with their firearms at the ready   we sat still  talked only when spoken to  and kept our hands fully visible  if asked for ids  we provided them  no questions asked  to this day  i sit still  talk only when spoken to  and keep my hands visible when stopped by law enforcement   in fact  when i m approaching a drug or alcohol enforcement checkpoint at night  i turn on the interior lights of my vehicle so the officers can see clearly into my vehicle and i remove my driver license from my wallet and pull the registration from the glovebox before i approach them  families living near refineries are more likely to be minorities    i lived in the permian basin in west texas for a number of months in 1980   we all lived near the oil refineries  a lot of people were making a very good living working for the oil company  many homes were within feet of working oil pumps   my mother visited me  she said you could smell the oil in the air and it couldn t be good for you  this affected all of the citizens of the area  not just minorities   no one lost their private insurance  according to joe  no  just those who worked for employers whose plans did not meet the requirements for coverage as outlined by the affordable care act   the employers couldn t afford the required changes to their policies so they dropped company plans and told their employees to apply for coverage through the clearinghouse   in many instances  there was only one insurance company providing policies through the clearinghouse  often being only blue cross blue shield   how was this fair to the american public  and then  penalizing individuals who  for one reason or another  couldn t afford insurance premiums but made too much money to qualify for medicaid  was ridiculous   it wasn t just the individual   if a taxpayer had a family member who qualified as a dependent member of the household  the individual was penalized again if that dependent member of the household wasn t covered by insurance  the whole aca was unconstitutional  period   not going to jail  for  cocaine   sounds like joe is more concerned about his own son more than the actual drug problem in this country and helping people kick their bad habits	81

324	AmundBisgaard	i would like to see the numbers that say that wearing a mask would save 100 000 lives   let s break that down  mortality rates are 5  for those over 70 years old  let s assume that the virus is 5  lethal for all  not only for those over 70  for 100 000 to die  there would have to be 20 times that many infected   20 times 100 000 is two million infected  if 5  of two million are infected  given a mortality rate of 5   100 000 would die   earlobe masks let through 97  of particles  it s hard to tell how to factor this in  as we can t simply assume that a mask would protect 3  of the population  getting infected would require proximity of people who are infected   joe seems to say that 200 000 more will die   out of which 100 000 are preventable by wearing masks   according to joe  it would seem that masks would reduce deaths by half  is there data to suggest that wearing masks would reduce the number of infected from 4 million to 2 million   i think biden is throwing around big numbers arbitrarily  without much thinking or understanding   if wearing a mask is so important  where was joe when people were rioting in the streets with little or no distancing or mask use  how many deaths did the protests cause  why is joe so aggressive on mask use and so lenient on everything else	2
325	AmyBrawlson	and you know this because why joe biden because you were there to build the cage or should i say cages you re just a sorry sorry vice president and you will be the worst president ever if you beat donald trump which i doubt it  better yet how about hunter biden he can afford to do it he s also not mentioning and i mean joe biden that s the reason why they re sitting in mexico is because 90  of the people who are seeking asylum in this country who are not showing up for their court date are felons how rude that you give joe biden more speaking time than you do the president of the united states shame on you  not to mention you interrupt the president of the united states once again shame on you  notice how they re holding all these debates and democratic states that is exactly why joe biden gets so much time and the president of the united states gets treated so disrespectfully  once again joe biden gets to say what he wants and the president of the united states the most respected man on in the united states can t even get two sentences out of his mouth without getting interrupted what a shame this is what we are reduced to  that s because they don t want to sit in cages you dumbass	0

438	Anonanon	this commentor seems set on creating a narrative about president trump being in bed with china when bidens the one with evidence coming up against him  around the 54 min  mark she gives biden a little over 1min 40 seconds to talk about how he ll be tough on china without interuptions  thats not including the near 30 seconds she took to ask the question  then attempts to block trump from responding  when trump refuses he is give just over 50 seconds with interuptions from biden and the commentator  and the commentator cuts trump off before he reaches one minute while hes explaining how hes tough on china and referencing bidens connection with china  she was probably worried that he would mention all the tariffs  the manufacturing jobs that are leaving china because of him and the other ways hes been tough on china  cant wait to see how biased this commentator gets as i finish watching  i hope this is it since i heard that this commentator was more fair than wallace	1

663	BarbaraLLowell	biden had the questions i am pretty sure   his final inaugural thing seemed canned and well rehearsed   trump has gravitas imo and still had the courage to interrupt   i thought she did pretty well for a leftie  but steered away from the hunter thing each time   the poignant takeaway leaves the audience thinking why in 47 years haven t you already done this   of course he blames it on the republican senate   trump has laid a fabulous foundation based on actual accomplishments and i hope with all my heart he gets to see it through   pray for him and send positive energy his way  even in the ethers it will reach him   he needs it  he gives so much to each and every thing he does   he really does show up   maga 2020  so glad i have the gift of being on the trump train   i have enjoyed these last 5 years after being a leftie dem for 50 years  got tired of the hypocrisy and using identity groups to grab power  then leave them flat	0

838	BonganiMiya	well biden  here in south africa we have rights to health care  come visit our government clinics and hospitals and see the skunk  the very socialists themselves  the black ones who own all the money  use private hospitals  the very teachers with rights teaching black kids with rights send their kids to private or multi racial schools and do not trust their own systems which keep blacksa in poor education and poor health care  the salvation we have is not based on our economy of socialist rights  but your very country the usa is funding us billions and you are supposed to learn from that  given you have been in government all these years and know our countries in africa are socialist and begging usa for help  and maybe you love beggers anyway  it makes you feel great and make your type of america great wall street is where you are funded mr joe these are democrats talking points though  russia again   so where will they be staying whilst undergoing  treatment   in my country your types say we families being ruined by our members with addiction problems cannot force these to rehabilitation  they have rights  it is free will  yet the very same arrogant government doesn t house them  instead many folk have lost furniture  houses and everything to drug addicts because the  loving  law does not recognise our rights as families to live in peace and safety in our homes so joe where is the money ging to come from in democrats shutdown world which is about the green deal  oh wait  green is environment  so money will come from the trees race issues in america are so horrible the whole central america and the whole africa and even the middle east and asia and them are running to america  you americans do not appreciate your country my lord jesus christ    joe is talking american sovereignty  what s that again in open border democrat liberal and socialist world leading scientists means nothing  science has split between liberal  socialist and conservative  if you believed in science  or if the un believed in science  then all scientists would matter  not liberal and socialist ones only  obama and yourself silenced scientist casey of florida who was using science himself to prove the contrary  leading scientists are leading because you fund them and you do not fund dissent   right during covid we observed how medical doctors and scientists were treated by your liberal and socialist  leading scientists  in any case  liberal scientists said the global warming disaster will strike in 1920 and nothing happened and it is 100years later and the level of the sea in durban remains where it was labour in most of our world is long pro socialismjoe you are evil  middle class and lower class families like mine were devastated by globalists like you opening our country borders to the 1 2billion chinese and our industries are ghost towns right here in south africa  and regarding your open borders  it is exactly middle class and lower class folk who suffer  and the only ones who succeed and become richer are poiliticians like you  we have plenty of them in south africa  i e  your types who lie with a straight face and think we are statistics joe says   i don t look at this the way he does  in terms of the red states and the blue states  we are all the united states of america    immediately without inhaling he says   by the way the spikes are happening in the red states   so how did he know that joe biden keeps explaining himself as being honorable   despite the videos where he speaks one thing and says another  i have concluded democrats are impersonators  they define themselves in the character of those they hate  they hate them because they wish to be like them  we know you biden  you are very bad it is a country they have never seen before  neither had they seen usa before when they were used by their parents as bait i have a feeling biden is impersonating trump  he is looking at trump s international deals records and thinking they are his  plagiarism and impersonator  talk about your record joehow are you going to lower the premiums joe  remember that the usa is the biggest economy  unlike our countries doing as they please and your types keep giving the same governments aid   who is going to aid the usa in order to  lower  the premium  how  whom are you going to be competing with in order to lower them  we already know  since this is exactly a socialist route   you are going to lower premiums by increasing the tax yoke  why are you guys ignoring lessons from other countries  in life we learn from the mistakes of others  the very reason there was a cold war is because you did not look at life from the usa only  but noted what ideologies and systems do or had done to other nations  south africa is right in your face and a great lesson on your progressive politics  we have the most progressive constitution and we have from almost 1st world to 3rd world and going down fast  because of your types denying you said you will ban fracking with a straight face like that defines your type of america  lies debate moderator  you are the best  god bless you and your family  we are thankful corona virus and advisors of president trump being respected  democrats  doctors  one of whom was funding corona research in wuhan  speaks of setup  now wonder it is major issue which takes 35mins of the debate and has to come first china will have to play by international rules  48yrs joe  48yrs in politics  your democrats endorsement of china and opening them up to world markets  you did not care a foot about the one sided socialist paris accord which even we in south africa could see was targetting the usa and enabling china socialism to rise  trump took the china bull by its horns and changed trade deals and beat the very un which works for socialists and china  so which rules will your china submit to  when they are above the rules in your world  like you yourselves are above the rules  is hillary in prison  no  have you cared to demand she gets locked up  the world does not belong to the usa mr biden and your lot  we are sovereign countries too can somebody help understand why those communities live next to those plants except for their jobs  it would seem our nature says food security comes first  that s level 01 in maslow s hierarchy of needs1hr43mins24 seconds is the crux of the whole debate or our differences  trump has made clear what many nations were saying all along  he is taking ownership and is making america a country which respects our countries  sovereignty too  within the precepts of humanity  the usa wont be fighting unnecessary energy wars again  this goes back to what i said in 2001  surely the usa does not need middle eastern energy  they can simply cut and trade with other countries  but clearly  the usa is concerned about the whole world  for if they were to cut trade with middle easterners  the whole world will implode and the usa will be the last ones to go down  long after our countries are obliterated	66

1144	Cestlavie	over 220k more by the end of the year  yeah bidden i seriously doubt both your feet are firmly planted on terra firma  not a chance  nothing but a socialist neg head  moderator is very very bias but hey thats america bash the potus unless     hes black	0
1145	ChadKuhn	biden  you know who i am   do we  you ve been hiding all week while trump has been doing rallies  you give the most vague answers possible  you side step 90  of questions to harp on fear  of covid  of global warming  of racial violence   or to claim trump s ideas don t work and you re going to do  something  else  you have no response to why you didn t do anything in the 8 years you had in the white house with obama or the decades you had in politics before that  basically the only thing we know for sure is that you re not trump  which seems to be what your entire campaign is about because you re too afraid to say what you ll really do	0
1146	ChadMatthew	wait  so covid doesn t jump on the co chairs but all the rest must wear masks   forget that    social distance or mask sure looks like a 3rd world country with mandatory masks in the building   despicable   we know the truth about the virus seeing that this was agreed to  to be about foreign policy   so  having 6 segments doesn t make sense  it would be nice to keep the agreement	0
1147	ChadRoche	wow   i have watched the timer  the moderator allows biden to speak for 35 40 seconds and then will tell trump he gets 10 seconds and she cuts trump off at 12 15 seconds  bias  i m so sick of it  for the love of god why can t they be honest          both are flawed  both are arrogant  both are self centered  both are rude  both have levels of corruption    be fair and let the people decide how can this moderator allow the questions and answers surrounding stimulus  medicare  medicaid  social security directed at these guys like congress doesn t control the money  the us president is not a king     neither of these knuckleheads have any ability to control how much money is allocated for any these issues  the congress controls the money  not the president   we are not a democracy  we are a republic and the president is not a king  i m so sick of this line of questions   the premise is that the potus can essentially do whatever he she wants    that s never been the case and it shouldn t  be    the president doesn t control stimulus spending congress does    the majority of the failures in this country are laid at the feet of congress  not the president  former president  vice president    people vote the ballot from the bottom to the top because the lower offices are the ones that control your life way more than potus ever will	2

1166	CharlieChaplin	the media will claim biden won  but it s clear who the stronger candidate is trump  when biden said oil it was his downfall he is done  he looked angry all night stammering and calling the president lincoln  trump will post the fracking comment and you who wish to open your eyes will see biden lies  47 years of nothing  but padding his wallet  trump has done more in 47 months than he has  choice is clear	0

1415	CraigWood	with the commentators after the debate the democrat donna brazile making the most stupid statement of the night said  i think the best president of the united states was lbj  lyndon baines johnson because he came up with the civil rights bill  do you see where her mind is  in my opinion  president johnson was a racist and did this to look good for the black voters  martin luther king jr and his followers did more for the civil rights movement than president lyndon johnson  i believe johnson was backed into a corner by martin luther king jr and his followers and johnson jumped on the band wagon to get votes from the black people of america and congress did the same thing to save face and get the black voters  but due to the problems of vietnam president johnson decided not to run for a second term    so my question for donna brazile  how has the democrat party  performed for the black americans to date  so it s been 56 freaking years     trump has done more black  hispanic  asian   native indian   white people in 4 years than 56 years with the democrats   just ask leo terrell and larry elder about what president trump has done for black people as well as what he has done for the rest of us americans  in my opinion  johnson didn t care about black people except for their vote  the civil rights bill was good but the law makers didn t put teeth into the bill and should have included more about economics and pay  so a lot has not change in 56 years with black americans  so basically what president johnson did was to  move some black people from the cotton fields to work inside the  big house  you know the masters plantation also known as  the democratic party   but i thank god for how he has overcome these racist democratic dirt bags by allowing them to die off and at the same time god kept on blessing the black people and they began to see the democratic party for exactly what it is and began realizing they don t need the democrats  nor do they need the republicans  the laws are in place and they need nothing   we don t need black lives matter  because all lives matter  what we do need is a savior and his name is jesus christ did chris wallace   juan williams even watch the same debate as we did  they are idiots  trump killed biden on the debate  biden is a pathological liar	121

1714	DejMar	the moderator on many of the policies shown herself to be intentionally biased  on others the bias being intentional or unintentional is not as transparent  but  if unintentionally it still exposes that her handlers and writers behind the debate are corrupt  if the former it proves her corruption approaches pure evil  the questions were formulated against trump compared to those directed at biden shows bias  it is wrong that the questions posed by trump to biden were unanswered  the allegations made by biden were not factual  but based upon fabricated conspiratorial lies  biden talked with a forked tongue  it is evident biden is not worthy of being a president  even by biden s own words he declared himself not fit to be president  though with his forked tongue also declared  with his lies  himself as being worthy electric cars are not environmentally friendly  it takes more energy to operate the car if one also calculates the energy needed to support the charging stations  if society wanted to reduce the energy cost there would be a more serious look into nuclear power  it is true that their is a risk in it  but the risk can be regulated in a manner that reduces the threat and possible damage is greatly less than the damage caused by charging stations  the poisons that are involved and can be exposed to the environment in the batteries and electrical storage devices are a threat  and by putting them in electrical cars creates a greater risk than that in the internal combustion powered vehicles	0

1751	DerekGabrys	this debate was better than the last debate  i feel trump won  i wonder how many people who vote are honestly still undecided at this point and watch the debate to decide  probably more than you would think   at least enough to make a difference in swing states  there are some people who aren t very politically minded and are probably listening to their pitches with an open mind   most people aren t going to deviate from their party and ideology but there are people who just want to work and lead a good life and don t spend time on twitter and youtube following their favorite political pundits  hopefully the majority of those votes go to trump   i am a libertarian and former liberal  i vote for trump because i think the democrat party has gone way too far left    starting at the end of the obama era  they have just lost touch with mainstream america  their behaviour over the last 4 years has been terrible  they are responsible for almost all of the societal chaos this year	0

1796	DiegoSage	basically joe s plan for coronavirus was no plan  but a bunch of numbers of a pandemic nobody could ve prepared for  and that he called a travel ban  fear mongering  from ground zero of the source  to then go on and put fear in my head about how it ll  get worse      finally to finish and say he s going to end it and make sure they have a plan    so like the plan isn t made yet or	0

2476	GinaOMarrow	in regards time the virus i think the fact that the msm was pushing fear and panic in the beginning  and the fact that hospitals were sending people home and telling them to come back if they couldn t breath and doctors offices closed so again people weren t getting early treatment  which caused more deaths  the way this virus was handled and continues to be handled by each state has contributed to more deaths  the president didn t decide how each state has handled this virus  biden pushes fear the whole time he talked about the virus  trump let people know that there s a very high recovery rate and that we shouldn t allow fear to dictate how we live our lives	0

2488	GlennPrice	you see how joe biden jumped off of the china conversation he redirected the focusrite to the public like our families needing assistance what a joke joe you can t fool us anymoreyou see how biden did not damage his self he said he has not taken a penny from any other country he has not he didn t mention that his children are his family had received money from other countries probably on his behalf  he hid from the truth i believe when you talkin about buying you talking about his family as well i mean who are we electing i believe the joe biden has a lot of explaining to do he should have never ran for president that just exposed him but maybe he needs to be exposed that is total corruptionyes trump has prepaid his taxes he said it and you ll find out to be true i m surewe don t want to see president trump s taxes what we want to know is why the moscow mayor s wife gave your son hunter biden 3 and 1 2 million dollars that was a nice little gift wasn t it  i guarantee joe biden knows why but he will never tell it he s a con manwe are not at war since trump s been in office i think they respect president trump very much as he probably shows respect for them you should respect your enemy you don t have to love them but respect them and if you can keep peace by all means do sowe already have plexiglass dividers we already have restrictions and restaurants what is biden talking about has he not been outside his housethis 500   kids question is a made up question just for joe biden let me tell you they probably came over and don t have their parents with them it s probably exactly what president trump said on this situationthen why haven t no parents come for the boost 500 children and said those are my kids because their parents are not here in the united states parents who love their children do not do that we would be looking for our children left and right to locate them heavy locators all across to the police department and everything else unless they have moved into this country in the hidden it won t show their face because they know they ll be sent backthe vice president is trying to emphasize the united states of america when he s taking money from china as a payout for china to move in on our territory who is this guythe stock market probably will crash if joe biden is elected because as a result many people will sell off their stocks then for sure a couple of individuals will get filthy filthy rich and the rest of us will be all poor like beggarsthe joe biden has been called out by president trump on that three and a half million dollars from china and how much more did they get the size that folks this is draining the swamp we can clearly see who the bad guys are  why in the world did the democratic party choose joe biden is beyond me he was the worst candidate for the position but they chose him anyway maybe china chose him insteadthe families living near the refineries question was a trick question and biden head rehearse that so that was a setup question you can clearly see that wonder why and biden has notes did anybody notice that i thought you weren t allowed anything in therethe commentator did wrong by shutting out president trump when he was talking about the minimum wage i see exactly what it means it s based on each individual states many many of the states cannot handle  15 an hour minimum wage no way maybe a state would our economy booming could but most small businesses will go out of business if they have to increase their wages by that some small businesses only pay their employees minimum wagethe children were ripped from the parents arms and now they can t find the parents does that tell you anything that s a total lie in what parent he s going to leave his children are their children behind only a bad parentthank you so much president trump for terminating the individual mandate on obamacare we didn t even know what we were going to do with it it was just another burden in our lives another thorn in our backside that one autumn alone what s a tremendous help to the citizens of the united states of americaso biden says he will transition from the oil industry in other words he ll shut it down eventually or either the democratic party will shut it down oh my god then where will we get our revenues from taxpayers  we have stockpiled are all four years upon years the government paid all companies not to drill and purchased oil from other countries so that we could keep our reserves in one day use them now president trump has came into office and is producing oil from these refineries here in the united states are oil wells are pumping again we are producing more oil than anywhere else in the country we are not having the fight in wars to protect all companies in other countries and losing valuable lives see hear ghost joe biden again lying about illegal immigrants children the 500 that are separated from their parents  joe biden does not know if the parents of those children are here in the united states that s a big lie they are probably back in the country of origin sent over here to come into this country knowing that we will take these children inreduce the premiums that s a big lie obamacare never did that the only way you ve benefited through obamacare s if you didn t have a job at allpresident trump was investigated extensively by the mueller investigation they found nothing wrong they found no collusionpresident trump tore up biden on the wall street money being raised amazing and yes biden took the money from wall street donations president trump didn t accept them because he knew there was consequences but that s alright with bidenpresident trump is correct we do have to open up and yes we can use precaution i use precaution myself but i don t wear a mask no longer than i have topresident trump has already said that pre existing conditions will be covered there s no worry about that they will be considered in covered fooling us with the obamacare was a joke 750 billion dollars taken from medicare that we paid in stolen from us to build obamacarepresident trump does not have to release his taxes your taxes are between you your accountant in the irs and if the irs does not find a problem with your taxes then you re lucky because even i have been audited and i m sure president trump has been audited many many many times that s not a concern of mine my concern is how well does president trump do his job while in office the irs can worry about the restobama even said in north korea was a tough problem and biden is for treating north korea like thugs instead of negotiating and getting along why probably he feels like he can go to china and get what he wants because he gives china what they wantnow this is bullseye he s talkin right now about passing the act for the stimulus package back in the summer they are stalemating they want us to pay for the city s sanctuary cities that have misappropriated their funds they want us to citizens of the united states to pay this back in the stimulus package that is meant for a pandemic onlynow joe biden is calling the leader of north korea a thug now what kind of communication is he going to have with north korea how is he going to get along by putting us in war with north korea believe me folks that would be not an easy task to do that would probably be a war with china as well it was years ago remember people don t remember that we were fighting north korea we were fighting chinese as well and russianow i honestly see why joe biden had to pick kamala harris  joe biden had to pick kamala harris because he had to satisfy the division within the democratic party and kamala harris represents the factions within the democratic party like socialist factions the marxist factions and yes the communist party faction along with the extreme far left radicals  that s why nancy pelosi won t start the 25th amendment  biden gets an office not long after he sent into retirement kamala harris takes over and oh my god what will happen to america china will have us at their mercy  maybe when obama was in office the middle east was a diversion who knows either way president trump took care of that really quickmine is lying so badly that is disgusting he will shut us down he s already said that he will require everyone to wear a mask you will be fine if you don t wear a masklabor groups are not endorsing this playing for climate change that would be like suicidejoe biden will not deny that his son didn t receive the three and a half million dollars from the mayor s wife that is totally amazing he knows it s true and just bypasses that every timejoe biden may as well tell the public that he if elected president will sell us out to the highest bidder and in the end his family will probably be the richest family in the world  he wants to impose all these regulations so that we have to decrease our productions in every area but yet china gets to continue there high admissions until 2030 that s 10 years from now 10 years for china to be filthy filthy rich off of the rest of the world in what happens to us we are third world country by then we can t let this happen folks and under president trump it won t happen cuz he s a businessman not a politician but more importantly president trump cares about americajoe biden is just repeating a lot of ideas that president trump has already accomplished with this pandemic maybe he s thinking nobody knows what president trump has done already because the media has not been telling the news correctly but all these items that biden has suggested president trump has donejoe biden honestly thinks he s a special guy he is a 47 year politician he knows exactly what to say to the public that s why he keeps turning to the public and saying these little comments when he s questioned on his family taking money from china are taking money from russia taking money from ukraine when will it ever again he s only about himself he cares nothing for us common folks president trump cares about america and doing the very best job he can the show that he can make a change i see that nowit s true about the stimulus package nancy pelosi will not approve it they have made counter offers from the president and from the republican party and nancy pelosi keep stalemating she s the reason we haven t got a stimulus check everybody knows that they should do your investigation folksis true about the social security i read about this joe biden has talked against social security for many yearsif you raise the minimum wage to  15 an hour everyone drawing social security will be at a poverty level bad choice joe biden horrible choiceif the billionaire s made 700 billion more dollars then that means that many many people were employed i don t think that joe biden can grasp that conceptif biden becomes president and raises the minimum wage and what happens to social security that he does not like and wants to eliminate you think we re going to get a raise to compensate for the difference in the cost of living probably not going to be starving folksi m sorry but joe biden does not care about the family that s only a gimmick that s he s worked on exactly what to say he s rehearsed it what to say as soon as china s brought up about the tariffs that president trump has imposed on china to balance the trade deficiti love it president trump comes back with i m not a typical politician you see how biden diverted the question concerning china total diversioni bet believe the russian aniron interference with the election is a joke but i m sure that the fbi will investigate we have to worry more about the democrats interference by sending out all of those balance some people got ballots for their little children some people got ballots for their dog don t know if that s true or not but that s what i keep reading abouti believe that anthony falchi should have been replaced he might be very well partly responsible for this virus in wuhan institute of virology lick it up do you research inform your opinion this virus came from that institute financial money came from obama for this institute look it up you ll find outhow come he won t make china do that as well at the same time reduce emissions reduce emissions because he s bought and paid for by china joe biden says very little against chinahe s not going to ask who built the cages she is a democrat i m sorry about that mr  presidentdonald trump is not trying to cut medicare that s another reverse tactic buy a lifer politician in fact obama took 750 billion dollars from medicare to create obamacare was it paid back probably notdon t let him lie to you he s not supporting the cops either he has to not support the cops in order to be on the side of the democratic party mini of the radicals in the democratic party want to defund law enforcement why it s beyond medo obama care as good as you can since you already have it and you got to go to court just to get rid of it excellent answerbidens climate change will cost the united states trillions of dollars are we in the position for that no not one other countries are not abiding by that at all are emission standards are the best they ve been in 35 years president trump said that let biden most impose more regulations on businesses here in the united states so that we can t do business here we have to ship it over to china because they can still do that business because it doesn t apply to them let that soak inbiden will definitely be for socialism because he will have socialized medicine he will have it as a mandate that you have to pay and as a result we will get less effective treatment and higher pay because the government will have to have a certain amount of money for administrative purposes and that s bigbiden thinks it s time to raise the minimum wage when we are suffering like this he claims were suffering like this but he wants to raise the minimum wage he wants to put bit small businesses out of business smart thinking he definitely is not an economist and he s definitely not a businessmanbiden says he later learned that his son was on the board at verisma oh my god after he turned around and wanted the prosecutor investigating purissima fired or they wouldn t get the 1 billion dollar loan from america they had only a couple hours to do so too much corruption just too much involvement he may as well work for ukraine china and maybe other various countries as wellbiden keeps talking about all this money money it takes money he s exactly right so his tax program is totally a falsehood totally lie there s no way he can only text people making  400 000 and above these people will move out of town folks they are not stupidbiden keeps returning to what the president knew in january but i know that he called the president a xenophobe when the president stopped travel to and from china he said that i don t know why she keeps lying about it and hiding it the democrats were totally against president trump stop and travel to and from china in fact pelosi went to chinatown was walking around showing that she wasn t scared of this virus apparently she must have knew more than we didbiden is an amazing good liar he knows he picked up kamala harris in order to please the democratic party in order that the democratic party would pull together not split because he knows that there s factions within the democratic party that has to be pleased as well when the democratic party should be concerned about getting them out of the democratic party instead i m referring to the socialist the marxist and yes some communist kamala harris is there to represent them and believe me they will get what they want especially if the 25th amendment is added biden will be in a rocking chair somewherebiden did say he opposed fracking why is he lying about that because you don t remember maybeandrew cuomo helped the virus to spread more in new york state by subjecting the older people tuesday positive patients with coronavirus by putting coronavirus patients in senior citizens facilities many many thousands died he is responsible for that andrew cuomo what does biden say about that he s going to make komo he is attorney general oh my godamy barrett was one of the greatest choices from president trump she is practically a near perfect person and perfect for the joball the regulations that you and obama imposed joe biden that kept china in business and that kept our businesses moving out of the country if we re going to have climate change everyone in the world should abide by that law at the same exact time no favoritism to other countries china 20 30 they don t have to kick in so what are they going to do in the meantime make trillions and trillions of dollars but us the united states we were supposed to kick in right away it can t happen jobs are important clean air is important clean water is important we can t do this on our own by one country only all countries have to be responsible for this at the same time the paris accord is horrible i m glad we re out of500 kids cannot locate their mom and dad they came across the border illegally in their mom and dad is back in their country they came in with another parent are they came in by their self the cages were built during obama but they re trying to blame president trump for it	127

2994	James	so 365000 deaths per year with the rate they claim corona has  don t the us have  265000 deaths per year from the annual flu  so that makes corona potentially  30  more lethal  if counting out all the palliative care given to anyone with  flu like symptoms  and are within the so called  risk group  which has been practiced throughout the western world  then the 1000 day would probably be quite a lot less   i know the number in sweden have been a tad bit exaggerated because of this very reason nhs is a lifesaver btw  far from perfect but it s so much better than nothing	0
2995	JamesAcheson	it warms my heart and gives me hope seeing all the trump supportive comments  i am baffled anyone could vote for biden  who do you want protecting you and your family  an outspoken alpha who doesn t particularly want to be president  a wishy washy pushover who wont get anything done and has slimed his way yo the top  or a senator who would gladly bend over and let communism run a train on her	1

3003	JamesBowman	trump had his moments no doubt and biden did too  now as far as delivery biden was actually better more often and i say that as a trump supporter and have no use for joe biden  i think if someone doesn t fact check they could think joe biden won because the potus went off on tangential rants far too often  if someone fact checks they will find that joe biden lied a whole bunch and his appeal to character seems ill advised    the moderator aside from entering the debate for a minute was the best so far and i was glad the president acknowledged it while in progress  trump missed his best responses all too often and biden is so lying about his involvement in ukraine and china and frankly taking under the table bribe money is criminal   trump hit a homerun with the cages question biden blamed obama lol  biden admitting that their crime bill was a mistake that was a wise move  trump reminding everyone he was vp for 8 years and did squat kinda took the energy out of it   end of the day joe biden is very corrupt  trump has gotten more accomplished in 3 years fighting the press  and rabid democrats than obama biden did in 8 years  trumps lower taxes and deregulation has worked wonders  getting the fed to lower rates and low energy costs have all helped the average working family more than anything the last administration ever did  obamacare is not good it failed to deliver as promised and increased the price of health care  policy wise the president is light years ahead of biden who gets his greased from very dangerous foes and that is a deal breaker for me    so djt 2020	2
3004	JamesChacko	president trump is allowed only 10 seconds to reply  whereas joe biden has no time limit to reply   moderator was very biased with hidden agenda of stopping president trump and debating him too occassionaly in a subtle way asking follow up questions instantly where biden was not able to ask	0

3034	JamesTrojnorBarron	look  i made a decision when i was 18  not  to vote for an american  would be president   i guess you can take that for what it s worth  two democratic friends of mine  stopped being friends with me mostly just based on that   i m not voting   i know that this was most certainly the reason  simply because we d never spoken of politics before and had been friends for ten years  tonight i thought the moderator was good and i think we heard enough and i m glad that it s over  i ll also give biden some points for the oil residue on his dad s car in the morning  that said    it was really much more special when president donald trump just looked at the man and said your the reason why i decided to put myself in this fight  i guess i m personally getting tired of all this blue political corruption that gets swept under the rug every year  it really sucks man  makes all of us look bad and act even worse  you also really can t expect the blue party to make a difference in foreign affairs when they re squeezing the system  you can t expect them to strengthen the economy for the same reason  and personally i feel that  equality  as it is meant to be observed and understood  is really being ruined or at least just taken for granted  by of the left wing agenda  if they specifically had it their way  these so called  people  would put every single republican voter behind a glass wall in a zoo for homo sapiens they don t agree with  my own mom and brother told me they actually wanted our president to get the virus while serving the country so that he d be dead and out of the way    i was a janitor and a lobsterman  i m 25  i don t have a lot of money and i ve wanted to be a writer since i was 11 years old  my dad was a cop for 37 years  my family fights all the time and my parents are obviously divorced  but with all the gratitude in my heart  all i m saying  is that i love this world and this life that i have  and i don t wanna ruin a good thing  respect to those who vote for trump	1
3035	JamesW	wow well its a best of the worse scenario  cant say much from the uk our boris wanted trampoline streets and to play wif waf on the dinner table  least its funny over here sometimes  do you think ppl will riot when either party wins  seems tensions are pretty high over there or is the news just making a show out of it all with likes of antifa etc  americans dont panic  so uh   biden  you got your supply of tp  cuz im sure a lot of americans went into a panic an bought tp as well as anything else they could get their hands on  so that proves biden wasnt paying the slighted bit of attention to what the population was doing in the beginning of all this  or is hoping we all forgot by now	0

3097	JayDub	yes  well said trump  give the power to the states  why do democrats think they should sit atop the most powerful government in the world and dictate how the entire country would be best  they don t know whats best for you and me  they will make a country full of people all the same  get in line  or else  joe biden actually speaking like a true fascist  dictator tonight yeah  let s not act like blm organization is a group of saints  lol  and for sports figures  extremely privileged  expressing their 1st ammendment rights     that s not what they were doing    they were using their platform to promote racism and segregation for political amd social purposes  they should be fired were moving toward net zero already  we don t need a bogus paris accord to do it  and i believe trump will continue heading that direction  democrats really want to take away rights and raise taxes  that s about all they would truly accomplish any different than what trump is doing trump is not anti immigration  he supports legal immigration and is working in speeding it up  democrats just want to open borders and have anyone waltz on over and sign up for free goodies  there are immigrants that came to this country  signed up for benefits  and live in their home countries hustling benefits from the us  the hustle will increase with biden  the government just can t manage it  and the democrats want to put more responsibility on the government sorry biden  you got biggest plans ever presented by a government  earlier you spoke of dreamers  your dreaming bud  the government and world organizations are not going to fix this problem  im not even convinced your  scientists  are actually right  it s political and about power resources  need to have social distancing  biden is a goof  the usa has great testing happening oh  biden would make china play by the international rules  laughable    hahaobviously its not as simple as scrapping obama care completely  the obama administration has made so many dependent on it  trump wants to improve it  without taking away healthcare  very difficult to establish great affordable healthcare that doesn t keep people dependent on the government  the democrats would have you bow down kneeling to them for health care mail in ballots are a huge risk for fraud  but joe pushes it  they are the least secure form of voting  imagine someone completing another family members ballot  no signature verification  no id verification  family members forcing others to vote a certain way  in person   voyer has privacy and can vote however their heart desires  its common sense  and people of all political sides have been packing into walmart since covid began  the democrats just don t make sense  encouraging the worst possible way to assure a final vote with integrity  forget about wrong ballots going wrong places  the government doesn t have perfect census data joe s 22 years of taxes and using loopholes  hahaha    what about your son biden  want to talk about alleged corruption of trump  or just keep ignoring you and your sons dealings with foreign governments joe  let s talk about what we re talking about      who built the cages  obama built the cages  haha  hypocrisyjoe doesn t see red states and blue states  he sees colors of skin  and sorry joe  your democratic platform behind you will railroad your butt  you are not in charge  you are not in control  you are not going to tell any of your leftist buddies how its gonna go  they will rule you joe its not trumps fault 200k have died  it s not trumps fault the schools are closed  the democrats are loving this virus its about middle class families joe  you won t save the middle class famines joe  you and obama didn t do it  and you democrats didn t care about them in 2016 amd you really dknt care about them now  you want to increase social spending  raise taxes to spend on services that people don t want to pay for  quit trying to tell everyone how to live their lives  you promise to give things away for free and then tax to pay for it  thomas jefferson would be rolling in his grave listening to joe biden  it should be illegal if joe was president the entire united states would look like ny and you d still have as many deaths  mayne more since biden wouldn t have shut down travel from china    hmmmm he s said it for 4 years  because he doesn t want to play your ridiculous games  i dont think its anyone s business  democrats just using it as a way to get votes graduate degree doesn t mean anything by itself  i was taught to be respectful to cops  i bet if i started mouthing off to a police officer all disrespectful like  i d find myself in a chicken wing real quick  if i reached into my glove box erratically while being disrespectful i might end up with a bullet don t talk to me joe  haha  i dont want your bs promises  lies and political jargon democrats governors have a huge responsibility  are they going to take any responsibility or is it just a double standard  hold the president to standards that no other high power politicians are held to canada s healthcare is degrading and they are struggling to come up withbways to afford it  the quality and quality will just continue to deteriorate  my economics professor taught me a very simple lesson  there s no such thing as a free lunch  somewhere someone pays  or there is no lunch biden won t create a better  biden obama care  lol  trump will do fine with it  it takes a business man  not a politician  trump said pre existing conditions are protected  so pre existing conditions are protected  the dems are destroying this country folks americans dont panic joe  have you been watching anything happening in this country over the last year  oh wait  you ve been in your basement co pletely out of touch with americans	7

3105	JayPaulKawatski	if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it  people will eventually come to believe it  the lie can be maintained only for such time as the state can shield the people from the political  economic and or military consequences of the lie  it thus becomes vitally important for the state to use all of its powers to repress dissent  for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie  and thus by extension  the truth is the greatest enemy of the state     joseph goebbels	0

3264	JodyDurant	the whole narrative suggesting trump didn t disclose the danger of covid is really old  is that the single best platform for biden s electection  really  over and over like we  the american people  don t actually remember the timeline and what actually happened  we aren t that stupid joe  not wanting the american people to panic was a good thing  this is the role of a real president  joe feeds off of emotion  not facts  not bravery  not logic  joe wants to capitalize on fear  he speaks in generalities  his entire dialogue is obfuscation	1

3272	JoeGerr	why did she say biden s name first when introducing them  trump is the current president and she should have giving him the respect he deserves as the commander and chief and should have introduced him first watch planet of the humans to hear the truth about how democrat politicians and elites have misled us tax payers to steal billions of tax dollars through subsidies  solar  wind and bio fuels has been one of the biggest frauds ever perpetrated on the american people and the world this host is another one debating trump along side biden it is pathetic  trumps gets 10 seconds  biden gets as long as he keeps telling lies let s all face it  we better realize as a nation how biden and harris are the biggest liars ever to run for office  biden can not stop telling one lie after another because of all the massive corruption he has committed throughout his time in office  everything he is denying has all been proven to be true  the documents have been released years ago but the biased democrat media has swept it under the rug  he even admitted to it on camera  yet here he is again telling lies to the world biden took money from china to look the other way when china took over the islands they built military landing strips and bases on  his record with china is disgraceful	147
3273	JoeGillooly	this was the way to close out going into the elections  trump killed it  this was a massacre  this was like watching tyson vs hearns  i m surprised it didn t end with biden on the floor and someone holding smelling salt under his nose	0
3274	JoeGreen	from my observations of the general public there s no way in hell biden stands a chance of becoming president  as long as the majority of people cast their votes and no cheating takes place  so if he were to somehow win then it will confirm for me my belief that the entire system is rigged and our votes don t actually make any difference in the outcome  it s already a flawed and unfair system by design to begin with  will we ever be truly free of corruption and control  i doubt it  but i really hope so	0

3285	JoePutaLiar	joe biden wants to give passport to 11 million illegal immigrants and give them medicaid and food stamps throughout their lifetime because joe said we owed them  how  we paid an average of  4000 monthly to each unemployed person  and if they have no parents  cost will be at least  8000 monthly  even if you raise 25  more tax to all middle class  we cannot sustain it everytime president tried to talk about hunter s china deal he gets cut off  trump has to fight to get 10 secs to respond  joker gets two 30 secs response time without even requesting	1
3286	JoeRenn	the only thing biden can do is try to hit on people s fears by saying things like  you re going to have empty seats at your tables   what a joke  you ve gotta be a simpleton to fall for that kamala  my boss  erections and lethal injections  harrisbiden   the laptop is a russian conspiracy  back to the future meme   hey i ve seen this one before	10

3310	JoeyPhenomenal	probably one of the stupidest political arguments right now is  200 000 have died from corona because of trump  coupled with  we  biden harris  have a plan to deal with corona    we get it at the debates and in the commercials  first if you have this miracle plan  why  have you not implemented it  senator harris  you get to present and pass laws  mr  biden  your party has control of the house of representatives where all the money gets spent  why have you not passed and funded this miracle plan months ago  why do we have to wait and see who wins the election and you all get your butts back in washington in january  seems like if what you say is true  and you did nothing but hold your miracle plan  those 200k are on you  2nd  when all the political nonsense is peeled back  there is not one single mayor or governor that can honestly say that they did not get what they needed and more  to keep the medical system from being overwhelmed  mobile field hospitals went unused  naval hospital ships went unused  charity mobile hospitals went unused  the private sector and americans stepped up and met the ppe needs  the partnership between the white house and the private sector cranked out ventilators and not only met the needs  but replenished the emergency stockpiles  not one  but multiple variations of vaccines have been discovered and are in final trials in the fastest time in history    i am too old to buy into snake oil scams and too experienced to not look at the real evidence record vote like your life depends on it  why   because it does joe s response to the 94 crime bill that incarcerated thousands of black men for pot and other petty crimes was   i made a mistake  tell that to all those men who were raised without fathers  instead of slavery reparations we should be talking about 94 crime bill reparations biden said he is shutting down the oil industry as his closing argument for the race  he just told 10 million americans he will take their jobs away anyone saying biden won is smoking more crack than hunter	255

3320	JohannesFiftyeight	the reason  healthcare  isn t  affordable  is because of health insurance    before we had widespread use of health insurance  we didn t have this issue much worse than the flu    the common flu kills more people each year and the vaccine is worse than the problem lol illegal immigrants are  asylum seekers  lol	4
3321	JohnAkridge	trump is right  the country has to stay open people are definitely commiting suicide for job losses and all types of emotional stress       i talked with a friend who is a detective for the police and he said that people commit suicide on holidays the most bc they have trouble providing for their family through and through let alone the holidays     so just imagine how much the suicide rate has grown since businesses are struggling and thousands have lost their jobs     and joe wants to kick the economy down in full effect    trump for the win	0

3327	JohnCamery	fake information   plexiglas dividers have been shown not to be effective  the virus simply floats around the barrier    non medical masks have been shown in clinical trials not to be effective    it was the obama administration that decided not to restock the national stockpile of masks and others protective gear the nation needed for protection at the start of the pandemic   it was allegedly this shortage that they used to force people to use the cloth masks that have shown in clinical trials to be ineffective   virus are nano particles   so  expecting these masks to filter out viruses is like expecting window screens to filter out the viruses   one or a thousand layers of screens cannot filter out the viruses   tests using lasers measuring  the particles coming out of cloth masks  they found that cloth masks split up droplets so the particles are more numerous and smaller so they travel farther and spread the infection farther than using no mask   the democratic governor also used a fake shortage of hospital rooms to force elderly care facilities to accept those infected with covid 19 spreading the disease  to those most vulnerable at time 1 11  the moderator cuts off the debaters and makes a political speech rather than moderating the debate which she compounds by showing she does not understand it is congress that allocates money not the president   then she starts in with questions based on false premises allowing biden to launch into the ridiculous propaganda and disinformation that he is being fed   the united states cannot force those illegally shepherding children across the border that are being deported to take the children with then when they very well might not be parents or legally responsible for them as the responsible government officials have explained   the commentator is totally corrupt making up false quotes alleging  them to the president	0
3328	JohnCasper	what biden did not bring up about his businesses is that he made them with people who are involved in drug and human trafficking trump never has the hotel business is different  secondly  had clinton got elected the us and the world would have ended up in a nuclear war  they wanted and they want a war with russia and the others  fossil energy cannot be replaced with windmills and solar panel that has been proven  i have people saying that to me who have been working on free energy devices but they are being hunted of course  biden do not have idea what he is gonna replace the current energy sources with  scientific institution betrayed the human race  they the fiction  they are the ones who work for oil companies	0

3337	JohnEngland	this moderator did pretty well  both men were able to complete their points and i don t think anyone s mike was muted  trump made sure to mention the now verified revelations from hunter s laptops and other sources  but joe gave the already debunked statement that it is russian disinformation  those latest revelations prove that biden is a crook and the head of a crime family  yet he has the hypocrisy of saying that he will restore decency and honour to the white house  joe kept using the same tactics of saying trump has no plans when we have been seeing trump s plans being carried out successfully on numerous fronts  and when biden talked about his plans  it is just as trump has said  pack the sc  eliminate  the filibuster  increase regulations  raise taxes sky high  put us back in the paris climate accord  cripple our fossil fuel industry and put us in the biggest depression ever  which  of course  he would then blame trump for  it is clear who will make america great again again  and greater than ever before  donald trump	0

3380	JohnnyDemaggio	the same allegations from the first election are coming up again and again  but neither candidate has really prepared anything to answer  obviously biden was gonna bring up his taxes  and for sure trump knew that but he basically gave the same answer he did last time  why not bring the proof with him  and likewise for biden with these hunter allegations if he has the proof  if either candidate had the guts to do that they probably would ve just swung the election and won for being transparent  both of these dudes are shady let s face it	0
3381	JohnnyDwyer	president trump answering questions from biden about himself   yet biden resorts to answer a question with a question  what s that about     now i seen some people thought biden won this debate  dosen t surprise me beings this is 2020  what would surprise me is if anyone couldn t see how fake biden was  how he avoided questions with answering with a question  how he lied and lied   if you didn t see that from this man  then you are a problem to this country just as much as biden and his party	1

than happy ready to go i love my family i love people but you ought to understand the reality of many things you can do what you re able to do and responsible you got up and you brushed your teeth you made your own breakfast you did your deal you went to work enjoy the people you are around except for some idiots yeah they come in many different types other than that life is going to keep going on it s not going to stop this world is not going to stop it s going to keep rotating every day you re going to keep doing what you re doing until god said it is finished it is done it s over with      this man of dust is standing there with donald trump yeah i m not even going to call him by his name anymore he just needs a tombstone his lies and deceit of corruption and everything else and his exposure of what s coming next it s already out there and i can understand why his son s got a drug problem just walking around this idiot it s on the stage i want you to think about that a lack of responseyou know what joe biden there isn t anybody that s influencing our elections but we do know who has been yeah it s called the soviet union communist party along with the chinese buddies spreading propaganda and the one that have violated elections yes proof is in the pudding just take a look at the last four years the democratic party have been in it they refuse to allow this president to do his job they did not relinquish nothing all they did was get this people and never forget it when he was swore in what was the next word they said impeachment has started they didn t relinquish nothing they ve been doing everything they can from one propaganda story to another right on down the line and what happened they lost the final narrative they ve lost control of everything and now they re desperate because you know why because now the wickedness and evilness that they have committed is going to be exposed and this is why they re fighting so hard not just about mr o obama but joe biden and the rest of the clowns that have had their hands in the pot for so long and all the murders that they have committed against crimes against humanity children millions of children that they have sold and slaughtered and killed and ate upon like cannibals we know what these people had done and guess what mr biden is coming you re going to pay god is going to see to it right up to nancy pelosi and all those that were involved justice is going to be delivered one way or the other because you know what all god s got to say to these individuals and understand this well because it s in the word of god he ll just look at you from a spiritual point and say your breath is removed from you and you are carcass will fall to the ground i wonder what the people are going to think of god spoke them words against the people that he saw do this thing that s right i think we be picking up a whole bunch of bodies putting them in ziploc bags sending them to the morgue to be processed and the excavator is going to be pretty busy digging holes to put these people in i want you to think about that mr biden because you know what real reality is god is already seen what you wicked people have done you this is what this is really all about because he s fixing to deal with you and the rest of you and you didn t think that we saw you didn t think that we heard you didn t think we were observing enough to see through the cloak that you tried to put over the people guess what you re the ones that were just made of fool and now you are the ones that are going to pay for every innocent blood that you ve shed right down the yes mr como i hope you read this because you re on the list you didn t get away either and neither did anyone in california and the rest of these blue states god seen it all justice is going to be delivered you know mr biden we know that you took part in this whole situation and we know why nancy took so long to come from one building to the next with them beautiful papers and on the very same day when they found out everything was prepared all sudden the virus hits on the same day as donald trump s papers were being delivered to the to the house you know what the military people are watching these wicked people and yes joe biden we do have a plan you haven t figured it out yet joe budden you know why you never became president because god hand is against you did you ever think about that no in all your wicked thoughts you will never see the presidential seat neverwell you know what joe biden i guess you got a lot to explain about all them transfers from ukraine and several other countries yeah how about the one that went to cyprus now i think there was a lot of transactions that went through that place yeah a lot of transactions out there guess what we got all the information too that s coming down the pike we re saving the best for last the reason why people are out of work is because of the democratic pandemic that s a fact they use this pandemic to crash the american economy true news not fake news we know what the democratic party was all about and this is what they have done this does not have anything to do with our president of the united states nothing does this has everything to do with what the democratic party had done that is real news that is real true and if you don t believe it you re a deceiver you re a liar and you re in league with lucifer and that s a fact because this has the hallmarks of the devil himself and all those that participated in it    the only thing i got to say people and i deleted all my other comments joe biden needs to go to guantanamo   and there s 92 democrats that need to go to guantanamo too for military tribunal and execution and there s a few fbi agents that need to be put in there along with cia individuals along with peter struck and yes his lover sorry about people that have families but you know what when you did what you did you should have thought about the consequences that were going to take place after the fact you didn t made a living holy almighty god have mercy on your souls when you get removed from public eye and you re not seeing walking around anywhere and the only places they ll find you is the place that they put fences around gravestone markers      letting god said justice is going to be delivered we the people are going to make sure that it s done social security s already bankrupt what are you talking about biden you and your fruit cup that was in office yeah you re robbed social security just like you always do you re robbed for money that don t belong to you you rob from the american people do me a favor just shut the f up nothing but a treasonous trader we ve had enough of your bs you re done you re freaking donepresident donald j trump you re doing a great and fantastic job thank you for standing in the gap for america you have no idea of what it s like for me to wake up and find out that you re still there standing in the gap i m glad that god has anointed you to do this task to protect this nation keep the great work up because i know whose hand is on you god s personal right hand and he is anointed you and appointed you for this next election you will be there and the living god has got a surprise for these lefties oh yeah and they re not going to like it no they re not going to like it all god warned what he was going to do to the wicked if i were them i would find the word of god i would be on my knees praying and asking forgiveness you don t your end will be the lake of fire in the final process and you think this virus is bad you ain t seen nothing yet the lake of fire for eternity wailing and gnashing of teeth total separation from the living holy almighty god   once the virus leaves the human body it has a three to five second life expectancy it will die number two it cannot survive outside the body it has to be in a molecule number three when it s very warm outside above 50   everything begins to evaporate the molecule is holding the virus guess what when it evaporates the molecule destroys the virus that means it s dead dead dead and we re finding out that somebody s out there planting this virus because of the life expectancy of the virus of itself we know this for a fact it s purposely being done and when we find these perpetrators i want them executed because we know for a fact that s how it got in the white house far left had spread the virus in there from a vial  the democratic party were doing this purposely to try to take the trump family out and also republicans in the process were not stupid we re watching everything that these treacherous wicked people are done and by the way democrats i got a message for you military term you re on the table and when this presidential election is over with and you have been exposed you re going to be lucky if you re going to be able to walk down the street and i want you to understand them words because every american s going to be looking at you waiting for that one moment and your life is going to end because of the destruction that you brought we know about the money we know about wuhan from china we know the perpetrators that were in there trying to prosper off this virus we know why it left china and came here we know what the full goaled was to try to take out as many americans as possible well guess what god s got a surprise for you you far left men and women of dust next time you ve been down to pick up earth in your hands i want you to think about soon you re going to be there mr president i have no idea how you can stand there behind that podium and listen to this bs coming out of this i can t even say it anymore mr president i just want you to know one thing i am going to be there for you november 3rd by the power of god sitting on the throne holding that beautiful scepter that sits there in all his glory on november 3rd 2020 the vote for you because god has anointed you to do the task it is time to take these wicked houses of cards and send them to the burn pile and i think i just spoke for the american people that are out here because you know what we re really tired of what these treacherous wicked people have done and now it s time for them to pay   if i remember correctly joe biden and barack obama s plane landed on the tarmac and within 15 minutes later they got back on the plains and yeah left because they told him to they didn t want to hear about any of their bs they just told him to get out of the country yep and the plane left the tarmac not more than 20 minutes later they were in the air kicking the two jokers right out yeah we know how about these clowns he s not running against anybody named joe biden he s running against a criminal that s right old man of dust you know what the worst thing is that you haven t figured out yet the hand of the living god is already against you yeah the superhuman being that s in the heavens his hand is already applied against you you have no idea how long you have left to live i want you to think about that in that little smaller than a pea brain getting rid of racism would be getting rid of the democratic party joe yes that includes youbid en you know what you re really a freaking idiot people understand this oxygen has a weight a virus has a weight do you really think plexiglass mask or anything other that you can imagine on the top of your head is going to protect you the virus is so light then plexiglass is not going to help you putting visors over your face are not going to help you you would have to actually be sealed in a containment with oxygen being pumped to you just like a diver in the ocean how simple can i make it    wake up when you go outside breathe the next fresh air without the mask you re going to be fine they are trying to spend a scare tactic to keep you afraid do you realize how many viruses that are floating in the air each and every day let alone pollen did everybody sneezes about i want you to think about that        the next thing i want you to think about is how much propaganda you re going to allow yourself to listen to i m glad god created the intelligent design all they want to do is pass a bill with a lot of money so that these democrats can line their pockets can t you people see what this is really all about you don t work with poisonous vipers you only get one thing you get bit and you die that s what these democrats have been doing for years crimes against humanity they ve been killing people for years they ve been lying their pockets they don t give a rat s whatever about the american people all they never did they never did with proof is in the pudding all you got to do is look at them don t look at the ones that are in office look at the ones that the money has been passed to and then given to these individuals that s right i call it the suitcase handoff everybody gets a big piece of the pie and that s what these democrats have been doing to avoid having it on their tax returns and everything they distribute the money everywhere else and then they get their little suitcase delivery    i ll tell you what these it is so hard sitting here listening to babe because joe biden opens up his mouth and nothing but poisonous seeds come out of it	1

3786	KingCrashPLAYZ	biden must not have taken economics in highschool because it s common sense that if you raise the amount of money companies have to pay to their workers to something like 15  then the companies that can t afford that will lay off workers   the cost of production would go up and therefore they would lay off many works to lower that cost of production	0

3984	LesBray	president trump is a guy that presents himself walt s and all  biden and his team are typical politicians groomed by marketing men  hyped and defended by an extensive propaganda network  institutionalised leftism is the problem of our time  they peddle the notion that it is wrong to expect an american administration to put america first  manipulative   disgraceful  deceitful on racism leftist  identity politics  and their pro racism group  black lives matter  section along with their facist like group   anti fa  and insulting policies  positive discrimination  and  affirmative action   has done so much to reverse the progress made against racism over the last 100 years no doubt the  green   movement is highly political  a large section of what we hear is leftists extremist using and abusing the issue of climate change to push forward their anti capitalist agenda  eg signing america up to national limits that will be met by exporting jobs and production to low wage high polluting economies  the left undermine the argument for any sensible science based environmental measuresfor two elections there has been accusations that russia and now china etc persuading the american people who to vote for  how is it that they have such powers of persuasion  biden is already trying to interfere with british decision making  promising to impose his pro lefty eu stance on the uk  in relation to brexit  not by means of persuasion but threat of impairing uk usa trade the universal postal ballot system of voting as promoted by the left is wide open to fixing  the left have shown that in their desperate bid for power no act is too low  too extreme  too unethical  if anyone is for interfering in foreign democracy it is the  democrats    is either party is involved in corrupting the voting system is is the  democrats  covid no one in the world has the answer  democrats are blocking a substantial relief package  that should be criminal a major reason for increased inequality in usa and other developed economies is the globalist agenda of exporting well paid jobs that ordinary people do to low wage low social cost low standards high subsidy economies like china  in fact many developed countries themselves are subsidising the second  wealthiest administration in the world  one example is the postal union that under trump usps is no longer a member  whilst under the postal union usps were forced to do the us part of a delivery from china for free  hence low wage zero welfare etc china was able to send items to americans for around 1 dollar   helping to decimate the retail sector and honest tax paying businesses in america  this despite the fact that so much of the wealth given to the chinese being used to stoke up their military and increasingly be a menace to other asian nations  president trump is the only one to date that is doing anything at all about this  so much is left to do  really what will biden or more significantly the harris administration do to address that  or will they reverse what little has been done so far	41

4050	LisaC	i m 61 years old and have watched donald trump in the media  since the 1980 s and feel confident about his lack of character  integrity and diplomacy  he was even on the first episode of lifestyles of the rich and famous on march 31  1984 with his then wife  ivanna trump  during the episode  she called him  the donald   which was a nickname for him for many years thereafter  in september 1990  there was an article in vanity fair  which is titled  after the gold rush   it shows what kind of person he is and how he has amassed much of his money thru his investor s losses  as a woman  i find his disrespect disgraceful and i actually feel sorry for his current wife and their young son  he s a very poor role model for a husband and father as that above article also discloses  as our nation s president  he is our number one diplomat for our country and he has made our great country a joke to the other countries that we deal with on a daily basis  his treatment of those families now separated at the border is appalling  and the treatment of our own minorities living in our country over racial injustice is evident in his tweets on twitter is very distasteful and demoralizing  and i won t even address  what he s said behind closed doors about our soldier s who have given the ultimate sacrifice for this country or the veterans returning home to their friends and family in a damaged state being a loser  it s hearsay  but knowing leopards don t change their spots    i believe it  now  in regards to the treatment of the pandemic  people look to him to assuage their fears and worries  so they have hope to make it through these current dark times  he s failed miserably by the number of people that have died from this deadly virus  he won t promote mask wearing  which is a known deterrent  that s seen on the recent coverage of the presidential rally s in pennsylvania and elsewhere     how many people were wearing masks  how many were social distancing    it shows how inept he has been from the very beginning this pandemic came to the u s  to the present	0
4051	LisaGipe	she interrupts trump when he is making a good point  and she lets biden ramble into the camera  pandering to the viewers	15
4052	LisaKing	i find it interesting  when biden was asked about what he would do about covid 19  his response was directed at trump  blaming covid deaths on him  he does not give any real answer other than  i will take care of it  it doesn t sound like he has a  clear plan  about any damage thing	0

4065	LiwuLiu	blaming china for virus looks like blaming cuba for a tornado originated in cuba hitting mexico gulf  a scapegoat  new virus asks for learning curve and both parties could have made the same mistakes as the responses come more from  cultural specialties as if eastern and southeast asia countries handled the virus more efficiently  the pandemic is a once in a century event for which a traditional president could have done much better  though the dramatic part is coincidentally american people elected a non traditional president for a short term need  which somehow does poorer than expected job against the unexpected pandemic	0
4066	Lizzard7	biden is sweating  he is completely out of touch  i wish someone asked him what the current minimum wage is  he said   6  7  8 dollars an hour   he has no idea 0 emissions  by 2025  lol bet that guy s never been to an asphalt plant	0

4182	LvmRhg	why was biden always talking as if his eyes were having problem with onion in front of him  especially whenever he was lying   why couldn t he completed the sentence    all men and women are created equally   by god    why is it so difficult for biden to say the name of the lord he believes in his faith   biden s view on the institutional racism is really the projection of his own belief on the color people   the moderator always voluntarily offered to biden to rebuttal  but the president had to ask the opportunity to defend himself and only gave 10 seconds   so unfair   biden is so unbelievable  if i were him  i would be fearful  to go meet my eternal judge the moderator isn t fair  always gave more time to biden to rebuttal but kept interrupting the president when he had an important point to say or to clarify   she always helped biden by asking him questions to give him opportunities to lie to the public   biden is such a fake  it s so hard to listen and to watch him biden has notes on his note pad which must be already there before the debate   joe really did not know what he was talking about but just throwing words around  especially he kept throwing numbers around to prove that he isn t senile	0

4301	Marc	i see a lot of emotional and biased comments  tons of trump supporters cult members  who are in denial of facts  trump had a point about the cages but jeff sessions was the one who utilized them with their zero tolerance policy   under the obama administration illegal immigrants were able to go to court and plead their case but with trumps administration they are immediately deported regardless if they were asylum seekers or law abiding workers  trump yet again dodged the white supremacy question because he panders to them as they vote for him and support him and he made a point about biden in the 90s but on the other hand trumps central park 5 was brilliantly brought up  i d like to hear what trump has to offer without the unsupported conspiracy theories  he talks about north korea   they have more missiles and are developing nuclear capability and on the other hand obama had them shut down  he brings up tariffs on china   everything is made in china so that only hurts us peasant consumers in the end  i havent seen my 401k get much better because under republicans these companies are only  encouraged  to give us more money but more often than not the tax cuts just go into the pockets of the ceos   healthcare is a big problem in this country unless you are active duty military  civilians are paying way too much but what would these rich folks know about that  trump went off topic alot and brought up unsupported conspiracy theories which is not a very good debate strategy drump the orphan maker                                           the best orphan maker ever	0

4684	MioHai	seeming irritatingly  naggling me  is the concept that a debate is not supposed to be merely a  statement  of position   it s not supposed to be easy  neither does it have to be  friendly   but time is money  so words shouldn t be wasted if they want their audience to think that they value our time as well     a debate should be an all out ring fight  fought with words and intellect  drawn to the last conclusion  so that there can be a clear winner and a clear loser  as dictated by sheer logic   castigations should be answered and answer accepted  whether it s acceptable or not  we wanted an answer  which should allow us to draw our conclusion   no rehashing  no takebacks   next subject     but due to this sort of  moderation  i m not going to see any clear ends coming from the biden camp  it s all muddied and chaotic and i can only assume that he really doesn t have a plan   i mean  if he s going to  bring us together  like mussolini  how is he going to make me like it   with our guy in office  i have a pretty clear picture of what s going to happen like a  plan  or something  that i m liking more and more  even without a foolish  unnecessary debate demonstrating how solid his plan is  vs chaos   this one should leave everyone who witnessed this with no other choice    the moving finger	0

4905	NealMcAfee	i say get the government out of any health care and give it back to the private sector and let the power of supply and demand dictate the cost or price that the american people are willing to pay   an example would be the way colleges   universities have become so expensive because the government got in the way of supply and demand  in the past  when the colleges   universities started charging higher cost or price to attend them and students that wanted to attend them but could not afford it  and instead of letting supply and demand dictate their higher cost or price to attend their colleges or universities  or  in other words  the colleges or universities would have had  to either keep raising their cost or price to attend their colleges or universities and end up with no students to attend them and go out of business or lower their cost or price the people are willing  or can afford to pay  but instead of letting supply of students affordability dictate the real cost and price of colleges or universities  the government steps in and let the colleges and universities continue to keep raising their cost every year and the government fiances government back loans for students higher cost to attend    i say get the government out of financing college and university cost and all these colleges and universities would have to lower their cost and price of attendance or go out of business	0

5297	Pixeljokkebit	it just bothers me that trump s lying about the pandemic going away even though at this point he s right about that we shouldn t lock down anymore  it s not going away for some time  what it will do is get more infectious and less pathogenic  meaning lower percentage of deaths  locking down would slow it but then there would be a 3rd wave  4th     what we should do is build more bed space and train more medical personnel to deal with the patients and pay that personnel more for their hard work so that more people see it worthwhile to be trained as nurses and what have you  it s still a lot cheaper to increase those salaries than locking down and it will also solve the problem with people not getting treatment during a patient surge	0

5370	QuantumMoonbeam	i have to be honest   as much as i love president trump  i was disappointed in his performance at the first debate   i felt he did better than ole  joe  but that s not saying much   some of the chaos was the result of poor debate management and obvious anti trump bias on the part of chris wallace    i thought the president outdebated ole  joe by a long shot during the second debate tonight  however   kristen walker did an excellent job of moderating the debate  most people who voted for president trump in 2016  and even more who will vote for him on november 3rd  did so  and will do so again  because of their dissatisfaction with the obama biden administration s lack of significant accomplishments and their implementation of policies and international trade agreements that hindered the growth of our economy   the president drove that point home soundly   i sure am proud of him	0

5404	RKadster	we all carry some form of bias  and while you might say i m not a trump supporter because i m uninformed  i can honestly tell you i have researched and sought out every aspect of these 2 candidates  i can tell you i m not a trump supporter because i am very educated on politics  i know what the truth is  not because of any 1 channel but because of all the news  this is a fundamental and critical part of what i m saying  think about this for a second  republicans get almost all of their information from fox news and trumps fb and twitter accounts  so in other words if your starting from a place of agreeing and sympathizing  with trump well then you would watch fox and trumps social media  now conversely 90  of what is called main stream media is backed by all other views regarding politics  now logically which point of view should you give more credibility to  1 or 2 media sources or the rest of the world   when trump is always right and the rest of the world is a conspiracy out to get trump  you have to start asking some serious questions about how much truth you are actually getting from those very limited points of view  this is why i look into things on fox news and abc  and nbc   i look into all of the information in order to see a complete picture  we live in a country were opinions may differ  which is why we have a bipartisan democratic system of voting  please ask yourself if you find any of this to be true on your own view of things  this is honestly not a slight against republican  democratic or any other view  it is just a very big problem and a reoccurring theme i am seeing here on you tube  always ask yourself if your seeing all sides of the issues   if you still like trump well then you haven t reached the truth yet   just kidding  trump  business s are dying   biden  people are dying  under your plan    trumps always a business man first trump is going down in the books  i mean he is basically the greatest self proclaimed president since abraham lincoln so he is a true humanitarian  except those 500 kids stuck at the border without parents  other then that he is a great  i mean most people wont even remember the fact that he was the 3rd president in history to be impeached  and obviously the thousands that died from the pandemic as a result of his irresponsible decisions  of course besides all that he would definitely be in the running for one of the greats in history  he was actually nominated by 2 people for the nobel peace prize  and here is silly obama who was not just nominated but also won out of 205 candidates  that s why i like fox news exclusively to get all my information on trump you see this way i can get an honest un bias opinion  yes i realize that only watching 1 or 2 media sources for my news could result in a one sided view providing me with confirmation bias  but i know the other 90  of the world is just telling lies about trump because they are jealous of his hair trump has hid his taxes for 4 years  why would he want to hide his global dealings from the public  biden s taxes are on display for the world to see  i mean he has the nerve to accuse biden of corruption  all you have to do is look at the actual evidence here the real question is who filled the cages    abraham trumpi think this point is very important proof 47 15 trump starts waving those tiny hands around when he gets nervous     trumps been saying he would release those tax returns since the last election  and he calls biden corrupt  49 30hey brothers  i see you been keeping up to date with all the latest fox and ny post reports just like me  i mean i know we only accept news from around 5   of the total media but that s because our cult needs to keep the conspiracy theories pure  now i know most of those accusations about biden are not founded on any actual proof according to trumps staff officials but lets keep fueling the lies and pretend their is anyway  because as long as we can distract the world with propaganda i really do think we can get the world to forget that our trump was only the 3rd disgraced president in history to be impeached  personally i don t care what trump does because i will blindly follow without any questions  even his dangerous advice that is constantly at odds with the actual experts  come on dem s you think we care about your silly science  now listen we are pushing our credibility a little on this hunter biden laptop scandal  i mean i m just afraid it makes us look a little desperate because again we have absolutely no credible evidence towards joe  i just think people might find it suspicious that we released this conspiracy theory right before the election  but i really do hope we can make america great again  one tax dollar at a time  i mean dumb old biden actually paying his taxes  what an old fool  speaking of old i really do love how we portrait joe as being such an incompetent fool even though our exalted leader is only 4 years younger  and how trump cleverly writes off everything from his failing global businesses to his orange cover girl makeup  but you know what i personally don t mind a bit  don t worry trump  you keep raking in the bucks and keeping the returns tucked away because the little people gotcha covered  and if those crazy dem s tell any more lies about our king its just because they are jealous of his amazing hair       trump on despite all the mudslinging back and fourth there is still one inescapable fact that makes trump look guilty 46 35 taxes  trump  i m gonna release them  i want too  set those tax returns free  biden  its been 4 years  show us ask alexa or siri who is likely to win the 2020 election  a lot of people are going of information that reinforce their own conformation bias  i was a trump supporter in the beginning but his lie s to the people are too egregious to ignore  now you can say your not bias  but the truth is everyone is bias in some way  trump has earned his hard questions because he refuses to answer questions like do you denounce racism  i mean this should not have even been a question of pause or hesitation  he does fuel separation in society by the polarizing statements he makes against anyone who does not support his agenda  biden is only 3 years older then trump yet somehow joe is to old  yeah he stumbles on his words over complex issues  so what that does not prove incompetency  this whole socialism theory is also false  biden wants the same healthcare that we have now just with more brackets to pay premiums on  basically let the people pay for what the get  how is that socialistic  trump has literally no plan for healthcare  biden s taxes are on display to actually prove his financial history  after 4 years trump has not shown anything  so who s the guilty one  i m just tired of all the lie s he has been caught in  and i m tired of our divided country  biden will do a better job of uniting us  at least those are my hopes  all i have are promises but his promises mean more then trumps lie s	12

5516	Reaper831	what i want to know is why no conservative nor liberal talk about how we are going to fix the problem with the destruction of the american family we are incentivising our women to have children from multiple guys to get large sums of money from welfare yett no one addresses it when they were talking about  systemic racism which i do not believe in may i add why was the fact that 80  of african anerican children are raised by single mothers why does no one have the testical fortitude to address this issue i think this is the most detrimental issue to us as americans  we cant have a sustainable society with out complimentary relationships between a childs biological mother and biological father and i must add although i dont believe there are much liberal eyes or minds on fox but im talking generalities here children growing up ti be stand up men and women although raised by a single mother  are the exception the rule is most men and women raised by single mothers without a strong masculine presence are more likely to suffer from drug abuse promiscuity in women and incarceration by violent crimes for men ex     when are we going to have an actual leader tackle this issue and how come most people are focused in the color of each others skin and not the statistics ive mentioned  im open to discussion as long as you keep the character attacks and ad hominids to yourself because i will not reply to disrespect	0

5586	RichardRabe	yet again biden that what the first stimulus bill was saposed to do but u and dem let some that money for go tm huge business and to your side dealslol biden did u forget u bragged  about briding ukranian to fire someone  or they get aid money u did that on vidoe and laughter about it	0
5587	RichardS	did anybody notice when biden claimed he didn t take a penny from any foreign country he wasn t looking at the camera  then when he started talking about disclosing his tax returns  he looked straight into the camera  straight into the american people s eyes because that was true  why couldn t he look into the american people s eyes when denying about being corrupt  because he is on the take and like most liars  couldn t make eye contact  unless you re slick willy  who can look at the camera  lie thru his teeth and point w o using a finger	1
5588	RichardSjaardema	i question whether joe biden has been living outside and comprehends how our lives have changed  his ideas come from a clouded life separate from reality huge fail when biden looks into the camera and lies to us china doesn t have to kick in to climate accord till 2030 and biden suggests we only have 8 years  more lies	358
5589	RichardSmith	we need tucker carlson as the commentator but it didn t happen unfortunately because the truth and nothing but the truth would come out   america absolutely needs donald trump too finish the next 4 years and if joe biden  somehow  wins then america is slowly going to turn into a communist nation and i pray to god that doesn t happen along with most of america  god bless america 1 30 you go mr  president	1

5613	RinjaniRanch	why does the president get 10 secs to reply but biden as long as he wants these debates are staged by the fake media  why are there no debates with pro trump moderators  why does the never trump moderator preface her questions to potus with her own slant  ridiculous  and the mask mandate is simply setting the stage  read the warnings on the mask packaging  they will do nothing to prevent the spread of disease or protect the wearer from disease  what a joke  is the debate commission non partisan  i don t think so so convenient for biden to lie about what he said  what happened and what he has done  no accountability and no truth  quid pro joe denies any wrongdoing with ukraine  bunch of hogwash joe  we have all seen the clip of your boast about firing the prosecutor  i can t believe a word you say does the expression  come on  man  mean  are you blind  stupid   insulting	16

5617	RiverLady	joe talks as if china and the ccp are not only capable of controlling north korea  when they can t  but he talks as if they aren t just as dangerous and guilty of the the same crimes against humanity as north korea   they are both communist countries that have killed and or imprisoned millions of their own people  how dare joe biden stand there and blame china for not stepping up and stopping north korea as if biden and obama didn t make things worse   not once has biden answered a question he s asked or taken responsibility for his policies but instead he s blamed everyone else for his failed policies and tried to blame trump for them too or changed the subject to something else to try an attack trump with   subjects like trump s tax returns when they re not even relevant to the question or conversation   i hear trump telling me what he plans to do to improve things and biden telling me he s done nothing wrong  saying nothing about what he ll do different  but instead he only says what everyone else is doing wrong	0

5667	RobertoLegaBuCh	each candidate has different positions   the sandcastles that biden built  trump blew to knock down   biden s ideas are utopias  for example exchanging cheap american fossil energy that works well  for a very expensive plan to implement costing trillions  destroying traditional oil jobs  raising rates to put into practice  generating recession for economy biden and his socialist ideas of spending trillions of dollars to change the form of energy production  from cheap american oil  to deploy 400 points for charging electric cars on highways   this seems like an unnecessary utopia  since fee payers will have to pay for it   it seems to take the united states to the hole   biden lied to him even when he smiled wryly at the trump responses	0

5718	RonaldMatthews	when democrats lie  it s quite obvious  their mouth is moving  a practicing christian who is an involved democrat is the definition of an oxymoron   the democrat platform is the antithesis of scriptural tenets  as in the book of esther  the enemies of the judeo christian community are revealing themselves for destruction  god will keep them in fear   confusion until the church is universally raptured out of this earth plain for the 7 year marriage supper of the lamb  these vocal enemies of god will be systematically killed during the 7 years of judgments   i would not want to be in their shoes  the elect will then return with christ to rule   reign with him until the ungodly are judged   sent to the lake of fire for ever   ever  amen  the rapture could happen   any moment   if you are not sure where you will spend eternity  i would suggest you read the 3rd chapter of the gospel of john  there are no prophecies that need to be fulfilled for that event to happen  donald j trump was preordained by god for this time   1 corinthians 15 53 kjv  substitute trump for trump    he was 70 years  7 months   7 days old when sworn into office   he was born under a blood moon   he is identifying   removing corruption around the world   christians have been given a short additional period to share the gospel  good news  before the great tribulation period begins  maranatha   christians need take advantage of every remaining second to make sure their family   friends will be in heaven before the snatching away  i heard a statistic that 72  of professing evangelicals do not believe that jesus christ was creator  god   this position will send you to hell   they crucified jesus because he claimed to be the  i am    john 1 1 leaves no room for any other position  god made man in his own image   he is triune   so are we   my mind could instruct my hand to pick up a loaded pistol  place it to my head and pull the trigger   my mortal body would turn back to the dust it was formed from   my intellect   spirit would live on for eternity   if i were unsaved   destined for hell  i would receive a body that will experience torcher for ever   ever where the worm doesn t die   if i were saved  i would receive my new incorruptible body fit for heaven   god can t allow corruption into heaven  christians are instructed to take our cross  deny ourselves   follow him   eve was deceived when satan tempted her but adam knew what he was doing when he ate the forbidden fruit   god holds the men responsible for passing on the sin nature   jesus was born without sin   lived a sinless life so he could be the second adam   redeem  fallen mankind   god had to become flesh to accomplish this process laid out in the old testament  god then made us free agents so we could respond to this ultimate display of love   be eternally saved   he did not want robots who had no choice   we are sentient creatures so we can respond to that sacrifice   he was   is all god   no room for error here   your eternal destiny hangs on your understanding of who jesus christ of nazareth is    maranatha	0

5895	SamC	trump s claim that he has had the best economic performance with respect to the lowest unemployment numbers in the history of the united states is false and fraudulent  under his tenure  before the pandemic  the lowest unemployment level he achieved is 3 5  in november of 2019  according to the federal reserve  not bad  but  under calvin coolidge s presidency  the unemployment rate dropped to 1 6  in 1926  handily beating trump s performance by a respectable spread of 1 9 basis points  then again  during eisenhower s stewardship of the economy  the unemployment level dropped below 3 5  to 2 5  in the summer of 1953  beating trump s number by 1    not much  but to say  the best unemployment numbers in the history of the country  is nothing but hogwash  and this puts into question almost any other claim he makes  there are plenty of other times when the unemployment level has equaled or been better than trump s performance  people lie  numbers don t	0

6230	SoniaL	ok half way through she starts interrupting trump but letting biden speak  seriously increasing minimum wage just increases the cost of living  where the end result is the same  look at states like california  new york chicago  make companies increase minimum and they will increase cost of their products to compensate  increase minimum and they decrease workers to compensate and lay bigger burdens on the few workers  i just want to share that home depot and lowes doubled the price on building material in texas because their suppliers increased their prices since pandemic  open our countries  stop holding our president backif theres anyone that wants trump to loose it is russia  turkey  iran  and china  they are angry with trump because of all the sanctions  tariffs  support of israel and in russia for putting an end to their underground pipeline plans which ted cruz exposed  don t believe me research insteadi paid for obama care for over a year and stopped paying and decided to pay the penalty because it was less than what i paid a year  i paid obamacare over  5000 in one year and the penalty was over  2000  i did it that way because every time i used obama care i still had to pay each visit would get an extra bill in the mail each time and ended up paying more than i was told  and it wouldn t cover alot of things so instead we would go to juarez in mexico for health care while still paying obamacare   my neighbor just broke her leg and needed surgery and obamacare wouldnt cover it until she paid  5000 upfront which she didn t have  she didn t qualify for the programs that the hospital offers because she has obamacare  now she s asking me how she can cancel obamacare but shes afraid she will get penalizes during income taxes  she had no idea that thanks to trump there is no longer any penalty  she canceled her obamacarebidens green new deal means controlling the population   look into agenda 21biden is such a liaraffordable healthcare means poor healthcare the government decides what treatment you get  and when and if you need that treatment	12

6358	StphaneRussell	president trump clearly came out winner of that debate  since he was kind of forced to listen more  his answers were also way sharper then on the previous debate  remember the  president  lesly nealson on air force one in naked gun  who sharpen his pen in his ear  well that s how you do it  lol   by being forced to let time to his opponent  they were forced to let donald trump worthy speak time  and that s where the magick happened  i already seen a few faces of people that gladly discovered that man for the first time in that debate  instead of the fake donald trump created by the mainstream medias that they are used to  even though they don t seem glad to have to admit that they liked what they saw  as for the moderator  she did well  but at the same time i preferred chris wallace  for the simple reason that you shouldn t have to maternise persons who presents themselves to occupy the most powerful seat in the world  me wallace was made look bad in the first debate and that s a shame  i must admit that in this debate  it must have been really hard for the president to remain silent before the incredibly false and weird claims from mr biden  i myself was yelling at my tv set  other thing  the moderator should also have allowed more time for face to face debates  she was too controlling to my view  she was supposed to moderate  not be in between	0

6501	TangointheNightBand	the mic muting worked  i think biden was taken aback by the scale of trumps lies  and i think the only other improvement that can be made now  because of the importance of these debates  is that they should be made under oath so that to lie is to perjur and slander with criminal implications and consequences  trump needs to be dragged out of the white house by the scruff of his neck and should be wearing an orange overall now	0

6550	TerriMann	when they tell the kids you can be president i guess it is true anyone can be president rather you know what you re doing or notit seems to me trump wants to play god the pandemic was not his doing it was god s people didn t have time for jesus so now he made this happen so we can sit down and give him our time and trump has the little red diamond on his shoulder he wants to play with everyone s life he don t care if you get sick and die    he s talking about the economy he just want to see how many people is going to die     he says he was   sick    but who really knows    he says he s not the one holding our money  stimulus check  but i could have sworn i seen him on a youtube video saying that he wasn t going to pass it until after the election vote for me and i ll set your money free   they shouldn t even let a president run after their 4 years    amenboth could have done better      no one really answer the questions     but trump needs to go you are fired we see how you ran for four years horrible his time is up     they both make more things more complicated life shouldn t be that complicated give us better pay we work the jobs they need us    give us our money lower the rent make the world and life a fordable and a better place amen    biden is okay but his vice president shoulda ran to be the president we need someone young    people like to make things more complicated for absolutely no reason amen     we don t just need health care we need affordable living an affordable life    i should have ran   as we know no law is set in stone they need to sit down re evaluate all the laws and redo the world   they need the people    they need us to vote    they need us to work the jobs    they need us to buy the product they need us to pay the rent they need us to build they need the people we are the teachers we are the police officers we are the store owners we are the property owners    and they don t even do us right    we live in homes  we can t afford we live in homes we can t enjoy we work jobs and don t even make good money     we are dying stress tired and broke    working two jobs and still can t even afford to live neighborhood don t even get updated    rent don t even match what the places look like they charge more for a three bedroom when you know the person most likely have kids and is barely making it    get it together amenand the reason why it wasn t working for people to stay at home when they did shut down is because they didn t give us enough money and people were stress broke and hungry didn t know if they were going to have to get evicted kids were hungry the stimulus check didn t even cover half the people s rent because rent is so high there was no real relief so people was reverting to getting beat drugs and all of that if he would have just froze the rent a5000 per person 1000 a child sent both stimulus checks a month apart people probably would have stayed at home he should have froze all of the bills and let people get real relief amenand i just want to add the president don t even care about our lives people are dying he s worried about the economy reopening where are we going i don t understand how business can fail    when the store close turn all the lights off and everyone go home why do it matter if it opened up the next day or not if people used to go to the store why would they stop just because they closed for a little while    why do you want to rush to send the kids back to school so then when they start dying then what people are going to remember where the school is and teachers will have to go back to work if they want a job so what s the rush  if a machine makes the money why are we all broke if money is just paper and they make special paper for big bill s but why have no one never counterfeit smaller bills	0

6558	TerryLawrence	just for your information i am not involved in politics at all and could  care less about democrats or republicans   however  i do believe that democracy is an illusion created by the  people in power to control others   i hope donald trump wins the election again and i want to explain why       with all the political issues with china and iran we need someone that  has the courage  to defends american s interest  biden is not the  president for that      we need someone who can still keep the economy open and running even  during the pandemic time      moreover  i really want to avoid a second civil war between  republicans and democrats  if democrats win  republican partisans will  never recognize and accept  the eligibility of this election  with this  in mind  anything can go and i do not want to be caught in the middle  and be a part of the collateral damages    we have to stop to think like most of the democratic leaders  they do  not care about the people  the only thing they care about is winning at  all cost  not their cost  you  my fellow americans are going to be the  cost  family  friends          keep in mind  donald trump can only have  two mandates  so  if  re elected he can only be president for 4 more years  after that it is  over  that will leave time to careful y chose a better candidate for the  presidency of the usa  biden is just another puppet in the end of the  democratic party  he is an old  yes  man  nancy pelosi is one of the  very dangerous master puppeteers  harris kamala is just another pawn  intended to take over biden s work   so  for the sake of the american  people and your life think twice about the consequences  stop being  emotional and be logical and rationally  remember the last civil war in  usa how many people died   last thing for all you reading my thought    lose the battle today  win the war tomorrow   god bless us all	0
6559	TerryProthero	there was some question about the moderator being biased  but i think this debate was handled much better than the first debate   the moderator was much better  and the mute button turned out to be a pretty good idea   i know the president probably didn t like it  but it really did help the flow the things and for us to  hear what the candidates were saying   this helped both the president and joe biden   when they are speaking over each other  we can t hear what either of them is saying   the president made one very good point   joe biden is talking about all these things he would do   but he had eight years as vice president and decades as a senator to do things   and yet nothing was done   as for the president s tax returns   i m a trump supporter  and even i don t buy that he isn t releasing them because of an audit   just say you don t want to release them and move on   but don t make up a ridiculous story like that one	0

6761	TomSmith	interesting how the moderator always interrupts president trump however not biden  worthless moderators  i wish they would get true professionals for a moderator instead of bias news people  she did better than the last one though  trump 2020  biden is a huge liar	0
6762	TomTRUTHTELLER	biden made a colossal mistake which sent many black people in jail  how can we trust that if ever president he won t make another which will cost life to a big number of americans	0
6763	TomTytunovich	putting aside the different stances on the issues and different styles in answering questions  trump speaking in broad statements easily understood by the general public  biden detailing plans and specifics   the one clear difference is that while all politicians leverage some division and fingerpointing against the other party  trump absolutely thrives on it  while biden at least cares enough to say it s all one country and he ll be everyone s president  and while talk is cheap  the past 4 years have indeed convinced me that trump is unusually polarizing and divisive  and that what america needs right now above all else is some more unity  in my opinion  that alone is reason enough to tilt the scales in biden s favor	0

6772	TommyH	coming from someone who s from china and escaped the country  i really wish the world realises how much of a threat the chinese communist party is to humanity in general  ccp s corruption goes way beyond the borders of china  they exploit the hardworking chinese people  blatantly violate human rights  and virtually use the wealth of the country however they see fit  joe s statements on making china  playing by the rules  is so very childish and blatantly untrue  identity politics  polarising people  censorship  cancelling culture are all typical communist tools to divide the public and push its propaganda  it s incredibly worrying to see these amongst mainstream western media now  as much as a rude  crazy and  unapologetic character trump is  or appears to be   he is indeed one of the only leaders in the west who s standing up to the ccp  biden is clearly corrupted and it s mad to see the media trying to cover up what is proved stories and evidence  the ccp has to be destroyed before western society can go back to democracy where candidates actually come up with meaningful plans of moving the society forward  this isn t about if you re a democrat or republican  right or left wing  if leaders of the western world keep on allowing the ccp to have its way  we are all doomed	10

6895	TylorWallen	you ain t putting no vaccine b      in megood thing they got rid of that chris guy from the first debate that way at least maybe trump will have a chance instead of having to sit there and defend himself against two people the whole time this time healthcare should be free just like it is in every other country except for the united states the american people pay more money for healthcare than any other place in the entire world for what for what they have better healthcare systems and countries where it s free to the public people then what we do even though there is billions of dollars spent a year in healthcare what s the problem how you going to demand people to wear a mask and when you re not even wearing a mask  that s like me at the restaurant that i work at we had a complaint because i wasn t wearing a mask by somebody that wasn t wearing a mask i mean how how stupid is that how are you not going to wear a mask and then complain because i m not wearing a mask i mean it just blows my mind that even though that it has been proven that mass literally do nothing because the particle of covid 19 is so small it goes through the masks i don t understand why it s still mandatory that we all wear masks me personally i can t breathe in that s    and i m tired of wearing it you ain t putting no vaccine b      in me	1

6923	UooHoo	if trump had anything fishy on his taxes  the irs would have been after him long ago   biden in the past had stated that  he never  spoke to hunter about his business dealings  yet   51 15 says that  hunter s deals weren t unethical  so how would he know if he supposedly never discussed them with hunter      then when asked about china  lies  lies  lies	1

7434	bakersmileyface	unlike the first debate where trump clearly won  i don t think i can see a winner in this debate   trump managed to get some key points on biden  but didn t manage to really hammer them down   biden managed to hammer trump on how he initially handled the covid crisis  but had nothing else on trump   i ve already voted for trump and this didn t change my mind  but if it didn t change my mind then i wonder what undecided voters thought about this   this didn t change my mind about my vote for trump because i absolutely despise biden s policies and he didn t manage to convince me otherwise during this debate  i also think biden has made too many mistakes in his campaign in protecting antifa  his vp choice and his decision hide  in the basement  as conservatives call it as well as his decision to focus all of his campaign on what trump has done wrong instead of telling people why he is the better choice  because as of this day  i still can t find out why i should vote for biden and i can only find reasons as to why i shouldn t vote for trump    come to think of it  that s a really massive reason why i ve voted for trump  i have plenty of reasons not to vote for trump  i have plenty of reasons not to vote for biden  i have plenty of reasons to vote for trump  but i have no reasons as to why i should vote for biden  biden has completely neglected himself in his campaign and focused entirely on trump  he won t clarify something like whether he is for or against fracking or something huge like whether he s going to pack the court  he won t tell us why we should vote for him  he just says that trump is bad  his policies are really the only reason as to why you would vote for him  but if you re like me and don t like his policies then you ve got no reason to vote for him   but back on topic  i don t see how trump won this  i d call it a tie  but i feel like trump really could have dominated this discussion if he didn t focus so much on the corruption scandal of which biden had obviously prepared for and of which the evidence found is still under investigation  there are plenty of other things that the democrats have done that he could have hit them with	1

8653	vincentrichBannedButNotForgotten	trump won this debate  biden won the first one strictly based on composure because trump set the bar so low for him by making it seem like he couldn t finish a sentence without a teleprompter and constantly interrupting  last night  trump had good defense and a little offense on his weakest spot  covid 19  and strong offense everywhere else  biden didn t land any new blows  trump landed several heavy blows     trump s points  and biden s rough responses  about biden killing the oil industry ending fracking  about biden s corruption allegations and calling joe  all talk  by asking why he didn t do any of his plans during the last 47 years were rough for biden after the first debate  trump needed to come up with a stronger defense for covid 19 and a little offense because that s his weakest spot  i heard him starting to do it over the last few weeks in interviews  and he did a good job of it last night  that s why he won the debate  the other topics were on his side	0

libs just trying to grab unelected   power  you have not fooled me    wow  hope joe doesn t yell like that at other world leaders  during the obama biden years it felt like everything that was good was now bad   and everything that was bad was good  it was like there was no father in heaven and jesus  plus  the issue of marriage split this country  some sided with satan    i stayed with my father in heaven and jesus    trump s correct about antifa   who the heck are the proud boys  yes  talk to a guy who shoots at people joe  interesting  trump s correct  antifa   blm and radical left violent protestors are going to eat joe up  who almost killed the mayor of portland when he ventured outside a few months ago  nuns  that s one reason why trump is correct  obama biden sent troops back in    iraq   which was not suppose to happen  against their campaign message  racism issue was created to cover putting troops back in iraq  that s what i suspect  i do not think there is systemic racism in the white community  some bad people   yes  and tragedies do occur  satan   is hard at work  he is our enemy  not us to each other    just thinking  no offence  i can say   law enforcement   joe  and i am a nobody    african americans have been voting for you for 47 years  joe  and how are they doing  before trump and reagan  i have been homeless and jobless because of my sins  and  praise the lord for his   love and mercy and forgiveness    and for finding a job and a place to live  now all is well again  but i didn t blame trump  or obama  or biden  or    america  i blamed myself  so after nearly 6 000 years of human history  now all of a sudden 3 5 years of trump is to blame  so laugh away  i am having a blast         going to bugs   bunny while joe speaks  same ole same ole  wow wallace   you acting like a bad school teacher  kinda   power hungry  maybe  a clown   wow  and trump is bad  i have never seen any biden clearance report  they are having a open discussion wallace  your interrupting  wallace you were trying to save biden on purpose  the obama biden taxes hikes caused the recession in later bush years  and it will happen with biden tax hikes  what a   rude  old man  yes  you joe  i don t give a   rats a   what trump pays in taxes   he pays more than me  no fooling wallace  let trump respond  do i get my 2 seconds back      now the sap stories again  bugs     bunny much better than joe  open up  use common sense  nobody cares joe         geeze  not mask again  it been a month  enough   wear one  don t wear one  interesting  only rich liberals   media   congress  entertainers and others snug at home   with plenty of stay at home money want shutdown    i have been working only part time since march    money getting tight  unemployment and stimulus can t go on forever  this nation is broke  other people have been working too since march  other people need their business open so they can make a living too  how is that desensitized  trump isn t a racist  but if that s all you libs got and still no solutions   then oh well  he increased funding to black colleges  crime reform   he pardoned a black lady   economic prosperity  and teaches man   woman marriage  how is that racist  i remember 1980 when reagan was a racist and more  both bush s were suppose to be racist  too  not  geeze  in february libs were all about impeachment joe  liberals don t understand distribution  obviously wallace does not  geeze  now the   sad sap statements by joe again  young people  this 25  this  5  that is just a liberal trick just trying indoctrinate you into believing that america s success is bad  that s all  who s the   angry old   pointing a finger at trump  trump was not letting these continuous   yearly subliminal remarks go unchecked at the moment  he called them out right away  great job trump  wallace your done with me  no more sunday mornings bye   just another hack  you interrupted great points in favor of trump to stop him from teaching  that s why trump won  he doesn t let liberals get away with subliminal remarks  this debate was better 2nd time     go trump     biden interrupted first

9605	TLee	why is it that biden can only look straight but can t look at trump in the eyes  does he lose his thoughts without reading the script  so bad  america does not need a script reader to be the president  why is it that biden cannot distinguish millions from thousands	9

9607	TJeanBlaise	so it wasn t president trump who started the interruptions it was joe biden and chris they both teamed up against trump and that s why the debate had a lot of interruptions  trump doesn t start the fights but does punch back harder  he figured that l am debated two one is more dangerous then other which was chris    watch the first 7 minutes of the debate you will see who started the interruptions  he was interrupted 3 times by joe and few times by chris wallace	0

9623	SuzanneNichols	wallace was the worst moderator of this sort of debate ever   but if people can t see the difference between someone who s had massive success in just a short time in office  compared to a person who has not only been a lifelong flop as a  public servant  then there is no hope for them  they suffer from  cognitive dissonance  which most call  tds   all  quidquopro joe  had in this debate was his same sad  meaningless  rhetoric  ask him to back up any of his talks with facts and he s got none  then he laughs  if the president had let him run his mouth a little longer we might have heard a bit more of his by now familiar bumbling nonsense    he also called our president  a  clown   he called soldiers  stupid bastards   he starts getting angry  insulting and threatening when he s losing his argument   which occurs regularly  anyone with even two operational brain cells should be able to see it    to even think that he or his vp who might have to fill in for him  would be able to deal with other world leaders in any way that would be of advantage to america is a great example of delusional thinking sadly typical of too many people these days  his and his son s alliance with china couldn t be more evident  and yet so many don t know  mostly because they get most if not all of their  news  from msnbc and cnn   and maybe our lack of civics and other teaching in our schools has come home to roost  doesn t completely explain why so many are so easily mislead and unable to think for themselves  there is a math professor from a major university who has suggested we should do better on our math   and i m thinking other stem subjects  to help re stimulate students  abilities to think  i think we should take his suggestions very seriously   as for joe  not a chance  i just hope he gets more time to talk   he is the best gaffe machine in the last  180  years	0
9624	SuzanH	joe needs another nap   climate change  which used to be called  global warming   but that was too obvious to disprove   so   change the b s  name so it can go either way   in 2009   2010 when al gore first tried to sell the tax on carbon emissions  we had the coldest winter on record  since then  we have broken even more cold winter records     wake up people and observe with your own eyes and learn to think for yourself    since when does the  moderator  attack our sitting president and not ask impartial questions   in my opinion  chris wallace is an eejit     i m glad president trump doesn t rollover and ignore these other two disrespectful rude people	19

9728	SlippyJones	this should ve been a ppv  this is too entertaining  this is not a presidential debate  this is something different    the ultimate irony  is just a few hours ago  donald trump said he tested positive for covid 19  it s a little too close to the election and a little too close after his pipedream cure for covid 19 during this debate  that makes me think he might be doing this to manipulate the election  i m not buying it	0

9733	SionLewis	there was a cut out at 1 20 59 when biden talks of a federal fleet run by   something  trump condemns white suprematists   proud boys  stand back and stand by  the way i see it you have trump and white supremacy on 1 side and biden and antifa on the other  as i said many times before  they are the ones dividing everyone in the general public  divide and conquer  it don t matter if they are a left wing politician or a right wing politician  it s all part of the plan  they are all in bed together  that s how the 1  stay in control  by keeping everyone divided  left vs right  thats how they conquer  so long as the left wing are against the right wing and vice versa  the corrupt will remain in power and nothing will ever get better  they may debate with eachother during elections  they may say some nasty things from time to time  but it s no different from a man arguing with a cousin  they are still considered as family in the end  so long as 1 of them gets the votes and becomes president  thats all that matters  but they mean to become president  it s just 2 people at the same table in the same house fighting over the biggest plate  2 branches of the same tree  it s the government vs the people  always has been  always will be  until every single man and woman from both left wing and right wing political backgrounds come together and do something about it  voting is an illusion of choice  thats all it is  when will people begin to understand how rigged it all is	0

9774	ShannonCancro	around 19 02  biden is  clearly looking down and reading the numbers   before  wallace even  began to ask the question biden was already busy writing   he had an ear piece   majority of the time that man doesn t know his own name but tonight he can quote statistics  also noticed every time biden started to go off the rails talking gibberish wallace would intervene	2
9775	ShaneReed	first off  i m a trump supporter  but i m not sure what debate most of you were watching     i agreed with most of what trump said  and think biden s an idiot  i didn t like  however  the way in which trump said it   he was constantly interrupting  especiially in the beginning   i think chris wallace did as well as could be expected   he pushed back on the president  hard on several occasions  as respectfully as possible  the only reason trump said he was debating the moderator is because the moderator couldn t get him to shut up and let the other guy speak     had trump s words come out of the mouth of anyone else  in a different way  the majority of the country would be in support  i  as well as many of you  can look past that  others are blinded by it  i think we should all recognize this instead of acting like the guy s infallible  trump is the perfect counter to the unrelenting assault by progressives  but a debate stage is a different animal   a debate is about hearing both sides  it looks really bad when someone is constantly interrupting another  after 4 years i d hoped that he d learned a bit about how he s perceived when he acts like that     comments about chris wallace being the oponent of the president are funny in that biden isn t much of one  but it s not like chris wallace treated him unfairly   if anything he gave him more leeway than he did biden   his question about the taxes is reasonable given that it came out just a few days ago  the hunter biden story is old news  everyone knows about it   yeah i would have liked him to be pushed on it in his response  but how much do you expect from the guy with trump constantly trying to go off in another direction   i came to check out the comments after i d watched the debate for myself   i was expecting someting substantive  but all i find is the type of commentary i d expect from the left  moderator was biased  he wouldn t let trump finish a sentence  wallace is a troll  etc     my personal favorite is the issue with chris wallace calling biden  vice president    come one people   it s customary to call a person by their highest title when speaking to them   would anyone here address president reagan  if he were alive  as mr  reagan  or president bush as mr  bush if you were to meet them  no  none of us would   just because you don t like him  doesn t mean he loses his title      you should all be careul  your bias is showing and it s almost as bad as the preogressives  i m disappointed   trump s not perfect  and if you can t acknowledge that  than you re falling into the same type of group thing mob mentality that has created the current progressive left  stop it	0

9903	RoloThatcher	i thought i could make it through this whole thing again but it is just too exhausting    biden s next lie  trump and republicans won t even meet with democrats to work on a bill to get people the aid they need to make it through this pandemic  we all know nancy pelosi is the only one holding these talks up and she continues to keep the country from the aid they so desperately need    can you spell  quid pro quo     biden says he doesn t want to reopen the economy and that trump doesn t have a plan  of course biden doesn t want the economy to open  because he is not the president  i guarantee if biden were president right now before an election the economy would have already been open because he is more interested in appearances than saving lives  biden asks the country how many of you woke up to an empty chair from someone who died of covid  this is another pandering tactic of the left to try to make the country think this is trump s fault that people died of this virus  the fact is  if biden would have been president   millions  of people could have died  because when trump closed travel to and from china  biden called him every name but the easter bunny  and don t try to say  well people still came back from china   because those were american citizens coming back to their own country  not people from china or other countries   biden and nancy pelosi and many other democrats told the country to not listen to trump s remarks about staying home and social distancing and that you should come out and eat at your local restaurants because it was safe to do so  we now know how that worked out for people    why does biden keep looking down at the podium  where is he reading from  does no one else see this  please tell me he doesn t have a teleprompter under his podium    i knew this was going to happen  whenever trump was stomping biden too bad he was interrupt him and say he had to move on or he had to give equal time to the vp    horrible mediator    another biden lie  he calls this a  trump recession   anyone with two braincells knows the reason the economy crashed was the unleashing by china of the coronavirus  before that  trump had this country rolling better than any other time in history  especially for all minorities  i could go on and on all day at the things trump got done that no president that came before his could even think of doing  and that is with no help from the democrat party    in the democratic debates the people on the stage were asked if they thought undocumented immigrants should be covered under the same health coverage as all legal american citizens  and joe biden waited to see to what everybody else did and when they all raised their hands  his hand went up too  so to say he isn t for socialism now is simply pandering to the people until he fools them into voting for his and then he will once again do whatever the dnc tells him to do    i am going to go point by point on here and see how that works  first point biden says we are in an election already and people have already voted in some states  that is true  but  you know the thing  is  you can t count those votes until election day  so it makes no different that people are voting early  because those votes don t count until election day	18
9904	RolandBishop	i just want to know what happened to all those promises that biden made while he was vice president i m not even going to do the mail thing  i m just going to the polls yeah you can t stop me from voting for trump  trump for 2020  mr president trump you going to take the usa into the future mr president trump  you are the man with a plan  in four more years we can go even more forward  biden has no clue what to do  if biden wins we all loose oh biden needs to be in the office to call these states to talk with democrat leaders to stop the problem  but after the election when trump won they all should have done just that  but all those mothers kept after him with that which hunt we have a lower deffacet with china now  what happened before trump  china eight us up with the democrat party biden is to old to bi in office  he is just a puppet for the democrats well the reason everyone is doing so bad with no money is because congress won t get together for a bill  and polosi wants things in the bill that doesn t even have anything to do with c19  she does not even care about the people  all she cares about is the kickbacks i have seen the difference in my prescriptions  i used to pay 35 00 a month  now i pay  10 00 a month	272

9929	RobT	when biden talks people so poor and medicaid  he s talking about illegals who have come here illegally  many of those people are working for out of pocket money and making  10 plus and demanding free lunch s as well  they pay nothing back into america  this is fact  by the way  i forgot to mention that the wife and i are getting better care with a lot less money as of jan  2020  i m still paying on mine but it was made up when the wife didn t have to out of pocket so much and the medicine cost has dropped  it s a proven fact that the cost is going down  it just depends on who you are dealing with  american s or the democratic communist  i m standing with president trump  a few things were left out about the biden s concerning hunter and the deals with china	2

9990	RapCat	no joe rogan interview  no vote for biden    someone make this go viral	2
9991	RandyMaatta	the questions had false assumptions narratives embedded within the questions   the ones on charlottesville and climate change in regards to the fires are two examples   there were more   the president allowing the other side to set expectations too low was a big mistake   trump reinforced the low expectations so all biden had to do was make it through the heavily controlled debate without a major malfunction or gaffe and he looks competent  wallace extinguished all remaining doubt that fox news is no different than cnn or msdnc   the president was debating two people on that stage   although biden lied throughout the entire debate  the president was not allowed enough time to refute biden s false statements and was cut off continuously   wallace ran interference for biden every time the president had him on the ropes   wallace also allowed biden to avoid answering direct questions   he pressed him a couple times but allowed biden to dodge the question   i hope the next debate has a different format that allows two minutes for direct rebuttal and a back and forth between the candidates   of course direct rebuttal introduces questions from the other candidate posed directly to the other side and the moderator is taken out of the exchange   you didn t see that  because think about it  that format introduces questions biden isn t prepared in advance to answer  if you think biden didn t have the questions in advance you are kidding yourself   it should be a town hall style where the candidates can engage directly   why the president s team agreed to last nights  heavily controlled format is a mystery	1
9992	RandyChamberlain	some one asked   what did we learn      we learned that antifa is just an idea  we learned biden will not say anything about packing the supreme court or even giving a nominee  we learned he is going to raise taxes by eliminating the recent tax cut  we learned biden is going to raise business tax back to 27  from 21   good luck finding a job  we learned he thinks odumbo care is going to be overturned  i doubt it  it will take the entire congress to do that  we learned he wants to lower prescription drug prices  oh trump already did that   we learned he wants to make historic payments into education  didn t odumbo do that too  that s right it didn t work  oh and we learned biden s green new deal is his and wants to refurbish over 400 sky scrapers to make them green  trillions of dollars    we learned a lot if you would have been listening instead of listening to the pundits    there is more but maybe you should listen twice	1

9998	RamiRingling	trump fails to denounce white supremacists  embarrassing himself and any who support him   still  most people here think the moderator is the reason he lost the debate     biden was able to answer his questions in the time allowed without interrupting the president   trump failed to answer most  of his questions while interrupting biden constantly  this isn t how our president should carry themselves  and all of his supporters should recognize that	0

10001	RaineyBurchette	they were like a couple of kids  but i still watched it through because i m a trump supporter  think back to a time when you were trying to do good and someone came along and shot you down  do you remember how that made you feel  this is what i saw happening at the debate  trump was being shot down by chris wallace and biden both  and it hurt trump because trump believes that what he s been doing for our country has been good  we who voted for him think so too  those on the left who think differently are going to cost america s constitution and all the freedoms and liberties protected by it if joe wins  therefore  consider all the threats against it so far by the left  consider the antarkists  and all the other terrorist groups that have been burning down america  is this what we want  no law and no order  most americans don t want to lose their  peace of mind and safety for themselves and their families  the reason joe attacked trump so viciously by calling him a liar  and to shut up and that he s done nothing to help the country is because joe is a politician  just like pelosi and all the other democrats that have been in government for half a century  they make their money off of america  trump isn t a politician  he s not in it for the money and because of this he s been trying to govern america honestly  this has been interfering with the left s gravy train from all their donors like china  and other countries  including many american companies  too  in exchange for favors   check out the video by peter schwiezer s  riding the dragon   it exposes joe s corruption and the corruption of his whole family     1	0

10150	PJ	i felt that trump was quite aggressive in this first debate with biden  which i think is unnecessary since his supporters are already dug in deeply to vote for him  trump is not going to attract democrat or independent voters by being so aggressive in the debate with constant interruptions while biden was speaking in the agreed allocated time slots  it could be a sign that trump is not so confident about his chance of winning  just perhaps	0
10151	PEACEKEEPER	trump ripped biden in pieces   chris wallace helped biden to breath   anybody can see the difference between career politician and a trained business man  biden said nothing    trump said it all  vote in person  get these career politicians out of office	0

10235	NancyMarihart	hmmm   mr wallace you went right back to your bias at the very end and talked over the president during his answers    two thumbs down on you as a moderator    thank goodness  towards the end wallace finally started making biden answer questions and called him out on his lie about the green new deal  whoa  the dems have had over 100 days to put down the riots    how are they capable of doing their jobs and putting down the riots mr biden   clearly your party does not know how to do their job and are too numb or immature to ask for help   or are they simply narcissistic and enjoy watching others suffer   pure evil    biden  you have done nothing but talk against this country up to this debate   you have caused more division between people in this country than any other politician     you waited over 3 months to say anything about the criminality of the rioters and have never mentioned they should be arrested for their acts of treason   this is due to your party hiring these thugs to create chaos and you don t want them to turn on you if you speak against them  wow  mr wallace  your job was to push both candidates to answer the questions asked of them     you never pressed plain old biden   not vp biden  to answer a question nor called him out on his many blatant untruths    i suppose if you like to lie by calling biden vice president when he is not the vice president answers the question for everyone   kettle shouldn t call the pot black  the moderator showing bias causes viewers to have a sour taste toward biden  as it causes viewers to feel biden has bribed this moderator  president trump   i am praying for evil to be suppressed by you   may you and your loving wife be restored to full health quickly   may the spirit of jesus christ raise you up victorious     may you know the majority of americans respect you as a hard working true american   you are not the low ilk of low life politicians who do are out of touch with the average american and use them to maintain their idle wasteful cushy lives  mr biden you called mr trump xenophobic when he stopped travel with china     you blatantly are lying     not helpful to your cause  mr biden  by refusing to answer the filibuster questions you essentially answered it letting us know you will end the filibuster  whoa    chris wallace is an unfair moderator    how could anyone choose him as a moderator   he interrupts only one candidate and talks over only one candidate    obviously no one who is intellectual could respect or value this man s work  as he does not act with professionalism	11

10497	MH	hi i m wallace a registered democrat   you ll both have your two minutes  but biden will be allowed to respond to any point trump makes while trumps attempts to respond will be treated as interrupting   i also have some loaded questions like denouncing white supremacist  personal taxes that were unethically attained  if accurate   etc     while i don t have any for mr  biden even though he s been in office for nearly 50 years and says he s the democratic party and these riots systematic racism claims occurred primarily in historically democratic run cities  im from german but if i m listening to this discussion and i m totally agree with trump  biden was a bit disappointing feels like he didn t believe himself and the people can feel it	21

10627	LeVet	thank goodness trump s mouth doesn t match his decision making  he s a mess and a joke when he speaks  where s a sock already     i like the idea of ending any  whatever  care and not replace it with anything  i m good with ending all and any female health care like planned parenthood    rvw    unfair laws against men   etc    he needs to make laws to protect men  as for covid  i think there are deadlier things out there but it must play out to the end and serve its purpose   as for biden  too much fillers and botox   too much wrong all around	0

10637	LarrySmith	why isn t anybody at fox talking about chris  weasel   wallace s performance   not even gutfeld   gee  i just don t know	7
10638	LarrySherrill	put a stop watch on crises wallace in his two minute segments and his fifteen minute segments and his interruption of those times  if joe didn t want interruipted he should not have started it    crises wallace violated his own rules   and today he is on fox complaining about donald trump   lets put a stop watch on what who did   and he did debate donald trump over joe s points   he is not a moderator but reverted to the biased reporter          he said    rules two minute  responses to question then  open discussion      first what does open discussion mean to you and me         it seems to mean that the two men engage each other in open discussion     the moderator did not stipulate he would guide open discussion    and three times when donald trump was making a point wallace stopped him saying he would get a chance to make his point in this segment   but he asked questions that took away from the point of open discussion   put a stop watch on donald trump s answering and i would not be surprised if there was time left in the fifteen minutes the two men had to respond to questions           i do know that in the first segment donald trump answered for 1 minute and 40 seconds and joe biden then responded for 2 minutes and fifteen seconds un interrupted   at which times as you stated  open discussion  begins  so according to his rules that he did not elaborate on any further that he would moderate this segment  donald trump began open discussion and it was joe biden   name calling    slandering   joe biden who interrupted donald trump in what should have been open discussion three times   mr  wallace joe started the rules of combat   and you let all his insults go          i would put a stop watch on each of the three times you interrupted donald trump when he was making a valid point to say that you were about to ask questions about that which question did not all him to continue   and i would put a stop watch on the fifteen minute segments but i don t need to  you cut short donald trumps answer and the fifteen minute segments you and they agreed too   so you interfered with his answers   then you did openly debate the president   if you think you are without fault you are very wrong          the voters didn t need your clarification of what joe biden was saying   when he was saying he was the party and burnie had no power why didn t you ask him who his cabinet choices would be   oac is supposed to be his energy chief   that means the green new deal and bernie is in	1

10645	LanceSnider	about 55 m in biden says there is systemic racism  then he basically says there  not when he says it s a few bad apples   systemic doesn t connote a few  biden seems like he was trained to speak by pelosi and clinton biden called violent riots peaceful protests and leaves out many details related to trump taking measures to show support for st  john s church and other people of faith  i m tired of the misinformation campaign perpetrated largely by modern dem s  they must think the public remains stupid and uninformed in a pandemic where it s locked in with internet access  chrysler gm never did  improve the quality of their vehicles  nor have ever paid back the bailout money to save them from sinking  i guess wallace makes up things about my home city  namely tulsa  the outsiders that came here to stir up trouble were quickly dealt with  things didn t get out of control like portland  etc	6
10646	LanceCahill	based on biden s answers  it seems like he knew the questions well in advance  biden has not done anything in 47 years  expect the same if he is elected biden will shut down this country for  months or even years if elected	310

10802	JuanCarrillo	the debate mention of the idea of antifa what the hell are they trying to pull  merely meaning anti fascism is a propagandized idea with the goal of blaming those whom elitists wish to rid themselves of because we are becoming a greed based problem   when a people  a nation of people  cannot survive their is a natural reaction  antifa is merely the natural reaction of survival   when you control the nations riches  it s money  it s means of survival  you control people s reactions and beliefs   and so this becomes the elitism last resort to invest in   humanity   we can t have the concept of fascism  when a nations poor lower middle to lower classes keep getting poorer   this is an oxymoron unless the plans are set to turn a constitutional nation and turn into a private nation  an aristocracy   the fascism is an  anything goes concept  void of any form of governing body  it aims to take advantage of and intimidate impoverished segments of that nation s poor  needy  its perceived  undesirable and demonize them and then bring them out into the streets  blame them and assassinate them  this has the potential of becoming a new modern day holocaust   this is the confederacy rising up again  it s a private nation refusing to become a constitutional nation  an example of  anything goes  is slavery and how fascism evolves to survival of the fittest style  predatorial society      this leads to christianity and religion traditionally falling into persecution   republicans know one thing money and greed as the core governing concept  this is simply put corruption and decay as its end result  and even an occult concept      university political science professors  influential representatives need to step up and educate the public now  clout and influence is needed before ignorance follows this path even further   these concepts are built into the pathos of trump and the party s political wants  elitism is what makes him and many like him pathologically inclined and empty hearted   this is satan s pathos  the money root of all evil  riches rots a man s heart and leaves a nations needy out to survive and fend for themselves   fascism runs in trump s vains without him even knowing it s meaning and ideology  it is pathological greed at any cost   you and i in the millions amounts to they re survival  this is the beginnings of a modern holocaust	1

10810	JosephMerritt	the apple doesn t fall far from the poisonous tree  mike wallace   it was unprofessional to ask loaded questions and to intervene the way chris did to prevent biden from answering important questions about the policy  biden is hiding crucial information from the voter and this is an example of the lack of transparency associated with the biden campaign and the obama biden administration	1
10811	JosephHoward	this was a very bias moderation  it is well known chris wallace does not like trump and it was apparent by the questions selected  nothing questioned about the riots from wallace toward joe  none of the false claims biden made were called out against him by wallace  no questions posed by wallace on hunter biden and his taking of the 1 5 billion from china or the 3 5 million from the mayor of moscow s wife  the only reason we heard anything about it is because trump had to bring it up  when trump did bring it up wallace would under cut him and dismiss the points  what made me most angry was the fact that the hardest question asked to biden was about packing the court  wallace did not every try to press biden for an answer  his lack of an answer was just not pressed  wallace knows trump was criticized about doing the right thing and shutting down the country early in the pandemic and  he also knows the democrats criticized him for his fast response yet  when biden lied about his answer chris just let him slip right by  very disturbing   wallace did not even make any comments about the ballots that have already be found dis guarded  which just so happen to be over 80  trump votes   i hope trump wins overwhelmingly	262
10812	JosephHavard	just watched the debate  chris wallace and sleepy  uncle joe were trying to tag team president trump   wallace was trying to cut trump off every time he started making a point  rabbit hole joe	48

10814	JosephBaker	potus trump   shut down all travel from and to china back in january  hey chris  how about calling biden former vice president   not vice president    this shows bias towards the left as well    chris wallace is extremely biased towards the left  and both biden  and wallace are extremely disrespectful of not only potus trump   and the very office of president of the united states    i truly despise the actions of biden  and all leftists   socialism communism are incredibly evil systems of government    i dont like a lot of things president trump has done  but he keeps his promises   and what he hasn t done is because he was steamrolled by leftists     i voted trump 2016 and i damned sure plan to vote trump 2020	14

10821	JonnaBorosky	chris wallace s bias against the president is obvious  by his asking questions as if fiction is fact  he s relying on dem points as if they re true    when biden giggles at the president s answers it shows total disrespect  and rudeness	0

10885	JodieHope	the way trump so quickly    and off the cuff    answers questions and so passionately    versus biden who seems to speaking but from someone else s mouth  somewhat unfamiliar with the facts    i can t possibly vote for biden    he seems frail    unclear and confused  wallace really showed his hand in this interview	1

10999	JamieCarroll	well then i urge everyone who votes to take a picture of your ballot so that if for any reason you feel that the election was rigged you can post a picture of the ballot that you submitted on social media    i hadn t heard anything about biden referring to military as stupid bastards so i searched and it took me no time to find the video clip  it s listed on several websites and it was biden talking about the things that he has accomplished with the military standing behind him  after he was done announcing his accomplishments he said clap for that you stupid bastards and then he said man we must be slow here    wow    but to this day i still can t find the clip of president trump calling military losers and suckers so again more lies from the democratic party regarding what biden said about having everyone driving electric cars  previously i was all about electric cars because i love the environment i love nature i love our animals  however after researching electric cars i discovered that even though they don t admit exhaust fumes they use batteries which emit toxic fumes  most electricity used to power electric vehicles is generated from non renewable energy sources which will have a negative impact on both our health and the environment  this is also a fact i quit believing in barack obama s environmental policies whenever he went to michigan and straight up lied to all of those people who said there was something wrong with the water  it is a fact that trees give us oxygen store carbon stabilize soil and give life to the worlds wildlife  these are facts  therefore i agree that by planting billions of trees  we will be able to have clean air  his goal is to heighten our economy while reducing carbon emissions by planting enough trees to stabilize our environment  this makes sense  and if anyone recalls   during obamas reign  water was not clean  air was not clean   obama s policies were total crap and didn t resolve anything  everyone knows by planting a tree you re reducing carbon emissions and releasing clean oxygen into the air these are facts that we all have been taught since we were children  do not fall for these demon cratic  lies  i looked up information regarding hunter biden and did find confirm documentation that he received 3 4 million dollars from the ukraine and he also went to china and there is no understanding of why he was in either place  multiple people stated that they don t fully understand his presence in either country  and this was confirmed under investigation  it eventually was closed and then was again opened for additional investigation  that s as far as i read about that  and as far as what biden says about trump calling military losers and suckers  try to look up any video that shows him saying this without media jumping in front of it and putting word quotes where it says allegations or reportedly  you won t find any such video  he had a lot to say about mccain and during that time it was understandable  it is true that we have an interruptive president during this debate and he should respect the other person running by not interrupting them but at the same time with the way biden campaign and his democratic party have attacked trump and made him seem like such an evil person when he is done nothing but wonderful things for this country including minorities all minorities not just black    well i guess i just would have a lot to say to that person directly as well as far as what biden says about being opposed to defunding the police  that simply is not true  he has supported blm and antifa this entire campaign  if you go to the blm and antifa websites and actually pull up where those donations are going  its confirmed that the democratic party is being funded by blm and antifa who are 100  on board with defunding the police  this is what a blatant lie looks like  if you read through bidens campaign page  it also has no support or plan for law enforcement outside of expanding and using the power of the us justice department to address systemic misconduct in police departments and prosecutor s offices  on his campaign page he refers to this as the obama biden justice department     it s only a new reign of power  the reason for the spikes wallace is because of blm and antifa duh  as trump stated before he is against any protest groups that are radical that are burning things down that are blowing up cars that are hurting other people it doesn t matter whether you re republican or democrat  trump is going to fix the issues in this country and he did a great job by declaring blm and antifa as terrorist organizations  he also needs to declare generally that any other radical group spreading hatred is considered terrorist against america  if we want to leave hate behind in our history then we need to start by getting rid of every single radical free speech organizations who take advantage only to hurt others   these people say they re trying to fix a broken system but what they don t seem to understand is that they are causing the system to break   they may not like it but there will always be someone at the top no matter what   i strongly doubt that anyone would be able to handle the kinds of stress that president trump has had to endure   by running our country he basically gave up his own freedoms  i totally commend him for that   and i swear if biden brings up trump playing golf one more time      does anyone recall jokes that consisted of where s waldo only it was where s obama   that man played golf as president more times than i d ever seen anyone completely disregard our country   i mistakenly voted for barack obama and i mistakenly did not vote for trump the last time around but i will remedy that this year  if this guy interrupts president trump one more time  i m not here to listen to you sir	0
11000	JamesVeach	face it folks trump was the winner of this debate tonight mr biden was just lying out his teeth like he always does biden is toast president trump will get another 4 years and it just pisses the left off they know it for a fact a trump will win	1

11175	HS	this argumentative  debate  results because the far leftists have lied for so long and taunted  attacked  deceived and injured not only president trump  but the republican party  independents   3rd party followers  the traditional democrats  the whole world  really  we all need therapy to heal from the emotional trauma of being attacked  this is like when someone has been carrying the problems of this nation on his shoulders while snakes and alligators are riding his back and nipping his heels up a rocky path  president trump is the only president who has been attacked daily by spineless leftists who additionally attack the citizens of this country physically  spiritually and mentally  president trump appears to view the debate as a chance to defend his position  work  and honor and the honor of the u s   while biden  being held accountable by trump  squirms  adjusts his hidden microphone  laughs inappropriately at times  swings his emotions from assertive defenseiveness to laughter to name calling and word salad  president trump is trying to hold him accountable for the hellish tactics and lies he is supporting  trump reminds me of someone who sees finally the spineless thorn in his side and attempts to pull it out  it is painful  but it must be debrided to see the truth  psychologically  one should expect this sort of  debate  in light of all the bullying  back handed attacks and threats on trump and the republicans since day one  before day one  trump is simply attempting to encourage a liar to come clean  he wants that the public wake up  who takes this job after years of puppets in government and tries to get us turned around right  a very courageous man who loves his country  the freedom we have here  its history  its people  his family  he likes biden only because he is an american  but he dislikes the lies and pretentious behaviors  it is stressful to work while leftists stick a microphone up your arse every waking moment of a day  would you attempt this job  that is ridiculous  who else could work under this stress and then give his salary away to charity  you know he is fighting for truth with as much goodness as he can muster  the debate gave an opportunity  but the injuries of the leftists and rioters is a major erupting sewer  still  trump is like the father standing at the door greeting a rebellious teen walking in at 3 in the morning   what the hell are you doing endangering yourself   only trump is asking biden to tell us the truth and stop  hurting this nation s chance at restoration and growth that has meaning when the intention comes from loving your fellowman as yourself  if democrats would attempt to work with the president he could accomplish so much more  we can do more united than separated  and attacking trump divides us  if you attack an elected official you are adding trouble not helping  if you attack our president s work  you are betraying the principles by which this country is founded  it is a conceivable possibility  democrats have wasted more money attacking trump than he has been paid  this nation should be repenting for the far leftists  praying that the snakes in their pants fall back into hell so they can have a moment of clarity  what are we rabid beasts  we show loyalty to our fellow human kind by helping our president  he is our president  you do not have to agree with everything  but to be a citizen of the u s   means you unite together for the betterment of all and support the president who represents us  we chose him together because he wanted this job and was the most qualified  i stay independent because it is dangerous to be affiliated with republicans only because leftist attack them by discriminating and plotting to harm them  that is not american  but hellish spirits from hades   independents can pick and choose without fear of a claw from democratic hades reaching up and pulling you down  this is a shame  but independents who can see what is going on know the difference between freedom and slavery  and leftists have enslaved the public with media deceit  monopolizing funds to punish people working for this nation	0

11282	GS	my takeaways  1  trump did exactly what i wanted him to until chris wallace destroyed the entire debate  strike first  strike hard  no mercy  when trump did that  biden had no answer except you re wrong and was even silent when trump asked him to name one police precinct that endorsed him  it was beautiful   2  chris wallace did an absolute horrible job  even independents are saying he was awful  he turned into a debater and not a moderator  furthermore  he interrupted trump way more than biden  he rephrased certain words for questions towards biden to make the subject seem less controversial  and he didn t press biden as much as trump on some of the reports and statements that he made  which were proven false   he let biden get away with a lot of lying and a lot of false allegations against the president  he asked the president to condemn white supremacist groups  which he s done many times already   but didn t ask biden to condemn blm and antifa  trump had to ask biden to do it himself   wallace should never be allowed to moderate a debate again	3
11283	GREENFIEND	chris wallace should get fired	0
11284	GOTKiDZ	obviously chris wallace does not know or understand the rules of debate  they definitely made and unfair advantage to biden  plus wallace hadn t been allowed to interview biden  so chris was very interested in what creepy joe had to say    one lie after another rolled so easily off of his tongue  he continued to try to relate to the public which we all know he s full of crap  so in the end it did not hurt our president  but it didn t really help him either  hopefully it did  trump 2020	0

11312	FranciscoEspiritu	from the opening bell  mr  trump came out as an aggressor  he bulldozed mr  biden and the moderator  chris wallace  throughout the evening  before the debate  mr  wallace had said that  if successful  his job was to be  as invisible as possible   he sometimes managed to recede  though at other times he was caught up in the shout fest  rarely did he exert control over the chaos   if you want to switch seats   he offered gamely at one point to mr  trump  mr  trump made a convincing demonstration of who he is  president trump demonstrated a willingness to lie  exaggerate and mislead during the debate  repeatedly interrupting former vice president joseph r  biden jr  with attacks based on thin evidence  on the matter of racism  mr  trump refused to condemn white supremacists  he refused to urge his supporters to stay calm  he falsely agitated the scarecrow of  socialism     while biden clearly and repeatedly rebuffed the leftist label   trump trampled over everything  like the bully  and clown that he is	0
11313	FranciscoCatalan	the fairest  procedure for the presidential debate is to print the topics on  cards and put them in a closed container  when his turn comes  each debater will  pick a card inside the container and will talk on the subject matter printed thereon  this will eliminate any suspicion of bias	0

11417	ElectronicBattlefield	not that i had much respect for chris wallace but i lost all respect for him tonight  he treated the president terribly and it looks bad on fox news	4
11418	ElectricOctopus	chris wallace did a poor job in my perspective   the moderator is not supposed to debate either candidate  nor attack them  you ask questions  and the candidates answer  multiple times chris asked a question only to interrupt them seconds later in the middle of their response    trump won this easily  notice how biden was the first to interrupt  biden was hardly able to speak smoothly at times and lost his composure  why didn t biden do any of the things he s promised in 47 years in office  just how long should making good on one s promises take	0
11419	EkenwaiwuEkenge35	few seconds biden said there is a systematic racism and later he said this is not 1950 anymore where racism is the major issue facing the suburbs oh which is it mr biden	0

11422	EdwinHolcombe	there is too much evidence that mail in votes are corrupt contrary to what biden said  moderator asked biden where he would draw line between environment and economy  he didn t  answer but only criticized trump i m  californian and i can tell you the fires can be blamed on the democrats in california mismanagement  they stopped forest clean up years ago increase in crime was under democratic governors  mayors watch  before riots crime was on decrease biden says trump caused recession  lie  biden may not be in public office now but he still could have made public statement for local officials to put a stop to riots  instead democrats  including kamala harris called for more  and biden s staff bailed out criminals  law and order increased under democrats support of riots  stopping police from law enforcement  and democrats bailing out criminals  biden   very fine people  is a lie  he misrepresents trump s statement  trump was interrupting biden in defending his son of corruption in china  moscow and ukraine   but biden only repeats it isn t true and says it was proven not true  who proved that  i ve  never seen it proven  biden is really weak on that  trump did not blow it after taking over obama s economy   trump improved it way more than expected  biden says that his proposals in building would  be buy american  good idea  however that s a policy initiated by trump  obama biden did the opposite  biden  millionairs and billaires have like trump done very well  notice he doesn t  include himself as a millionaire   also the unemployment rates coming down is not specific to millionaires but to general population at large  trump is right that scientists have changed their tune about masks moderator consistently interrupts trump but not biden  trump challenging how smart biden is was a useless waste of time  trump could have defended himself  biden said that trump wanted us to inject disinfectant into veins is a lie  trump not allowed to defend  biden s narrative on trump s  action on covid is false  and he says we need to get funding out but it was pelosi and dems who stalled funding  biden says trump delayed action but trump stopped arrivals from china and biden criticized that move although he has since changed his view   moderator does not interrupt biden  but stops trump from speaking  he did not let trump defend his actions on covid  trump was right that biden refused to answer whether he would pack the court  biden is right that trump has failed to come up with a comprehensive health plan  biden    because of his  trump s  recession   lie  recession is orchestrated by democrats  the moderator would not allow trump to finish answer what he s done on medical but did not interrupt biden  biden s response about choosing a new scotus judge is off  he says the people should get to choose thru their elected senators a president so therefore should wait till after election  the people have already chosen thru their senatirs and president who they voted on in this term and it was in this term the justice ruth died  biden lost and proved to be a hypocrite on this	88

11511	DianeArk	this is what i cannot get over with biden and the democrats  they keep saying let the people decide the election to make the decisions  yet the democrats couldn t accept trump as president  and they lied to over throw him  one lady was in an elevator with nadler during the impeachment and said to him   why are you trying to attempt to make my vote for trump void  he said nothing  and biden is caught in lies such as his son hunter did nothing wrong with russia  and he refuses to admit that he is in favor of socialism and defunding the police  proof is picking his vice president who has definitely said publicly that she favors both of these issues  and last  who cares if trump golfs   and the more i admire him for what he accomplishes in one day and he still has time to golf   trump is most certainly the best president this country has ever had  and god help us if biden wins the election	0

11544	DebraWilson	when biden was vp we had the worst economy ever and obama care was so expensive and  really messed up  you could look at all their reviews with all the problems it created for people  please  please  please do a do over with a different moderator who actually allows each candidate to respond to remarks their opponent has said  this has been done in the past and it works well  you can t favor biden as wallace did and call it a debate  biden gets his 5 minutes and trump gets cut off  biden tells him to shut up and wallace does the same by telling him your time is up  you can t speak  you can t respond to biden s accusations  wallace to trump  you didn t pay enough taxes did you but never brings up biden s family stuff   they are both equally alleged so why wasn t it fair	2

11552	DebbieGeshem	stop trying to insert yourself interject yourself into the debate chris  i spent this debate repeating   shut up  chris   we wanted to hear what the president was saying  and you owed him the respect of leaving him the floor after asking a question  you interrupted the president s statements almost every time  put your personal feelings aside please	2
11553	Debbie	biden   democrats are alway copie donald j  trump great ideas  they act just like communist of china  perhaps biden is colluded with ccp for too long  the president has had years of being attacked and never gets to confront them and he was debating 2 people tonight     while being cut off at every turn   he was impassioned	25

11561	DawnCarlson	obviously this is a one sided debate     i can t believe fox wasn t backing our president or if chris wallace high jacked this debate on purpose and should be fired  every news station who is pushing propaganda should be shut down  it s a travesty how democrats are lying about their intentions to make sure we have health care  the health care i have been given by democrats  was so great i went 30 years out of 47 with a tumor on my parathyroid   i ve been on ma most of my life and sick from the tumor   so thanks for your wonderful healthcare democrats   i agree  chris wallace   is a horrible commentary  he s arguing with the president  he s rude and he s not the only one  it s amazing how biden isn t answering anything about the big pharma comments trump s making  i d like to point out biden is not vp  former vp is the correct name   joe biden is the one who lies  sam donaldson called him out on it  he s an awful man  biden needs a nursing home	0

11586	DaveyGecko	wallace says    in the interest of the people  yet when trump   delivers important  and relevant information  insulin example  wallace decides that   that  isn t  in the interest of the american people   breaking the format of the debate is radically informal  but it s a debate and the stakes make getting the information across  beyond the boundaries of the format  relevant  and it still actually serves the whole point of the interaction  to get the important information across  it s a fine line using moderating to keep a  debate  going when skewed questions and at time biased opinions castrate important parts of those responses baring weighty information  is wallace trying to have a monopoly on what the public should know         sending love  wisdom and courage to all  let s hope these debates revel the truth wherever it is  good starting point is the spine  both metaphorically  literarily  truth can stand on it s own accord and can t be budged  refers to video above	0

11954	BekaMorris	interruptions and low blows are the only way trump thinks he can win this debate while biden tries to take the high road and not take the bait and reply back every time  trump is just using this as a platform to expose biden s weaknesses instead of focusing on the questions  in my eyes biden actually cares about the working class and has definitely won this first debate	0

12041	AntonKala	the poor who are m ny in us  and the antitrumpers   may be majority now and they will vote for biden who may win but so far noone knows yet what will happen in november  it is danger it looks like the business people may vote for biden because he said that he will give money to them and that may give to biden the chance to win but pro trump are mostly the elders who will pay less for medicine because trump will save them money  youths may be mostly with biden but adults may be mostly with trump in the farms small town and less in the big cities economy will influence in votes this november will show america   what has more inside it of leftist or of the right camps and how many in total will vote  after that may be more messy war between the two angry camps who may divide usa in 2021 trump started good but than started acting like in his old aprentice show and biden did try to be more normal and than after the show became a true comedy and a messy one after 10 min because they did fight  interrupt nonstop each other biden offended trump saying shut up clown etc	0

12059	AnnaBorgeson	chris wallace was the worst debate moderator yet   he was  biased and rude   he kept tell trump to quit interrupting   what about him   he interrupted trump at every turn a d would not let him finish any sentence    what an egotistical liberal idiot   find another job   i used to like fox news   now its trash like all the rest of them	0
12060	AnnNewell	look he did it twice         3 times you noticed biden said how ya doin man  then he referred the urban community as taking a left hand turn  pretty sneaky and probably overlooked	0

12062	AngieLynne	a presidential attack by wallace and biden  he s debating wallace and biden   wow i m so glad to hear these comments  i thought it was just me  chris wallace is definitely for the left  he is not giving our president as much time as biden  he is sooooo argumentative with  our president but coddling biden  i don t know if you have realized but it s also about the camera angle  they were letting biden talk directly to the people very heartfelt in the camera without interference  if they keep letting biden do this and keep cutting off president trump off  it might be an issue  i hate watching wallace talking to president trump like a child  ugh	6
12063	AngieAngel	fox news is loosing it  i might not be fond of xhris wallace  you idiot xhris needs to check the feeble minded because he might be a president  time will tell what s going to happen  joe biden has an old persons disease  and you know what i mean when i say that  and i do not care how much drugs they pump into him  like steroids  and by the way  if i ever become rich and powerful  i m unapologetic  you reap what you sow	0

12067	AngelaJerram	biden only cares about lining his own pockets and his sons pockets it s obvious  trump cares about the people and creating the best ever economy  which he is defiantly qualified to do  lots of african americans love trump but i don t think they are impressed with biden actually  poor biden he s owned and afraid easy puppet material  trump is strong and isn t afraid of anyone  he is bold and strong and fearless  and deserves to be presedent and so do the americam people  it s great how trump is educating biden because i think he is very much stuck in the past and isn t great with his maths and statistics  53 people shot in one democratic state  msm didn t report that  the democratic states have been run into the ground so who would vote one  america needs trump to make america great again and hopefully the rest of the world will see this	1

12073	AndrewTo	i think americans said enough about this debate   moderator is biased and being unfair for president trump	12
12074	AndrewTaylor	trump missed a lot of opportunities where he did not emphasize his record  he mostly just made sarcastic comments   he was clearly frustrated  but he still has to appeal to the electorate   for the next debate  he should prepare to talk to people regarding his record on taxes  the overall economy  trade  jobs  healthcare  defense  protecting the border etc  he really was off the mark in the first debate	0
12075	AndrewTV	chris wallis is a trump hater in fact	0
12076	AndrewSitto	the history of antifa  america s cities have endured a summer of anarchy  from minneapolis to chicago to portland  radical leftist have burned  looted and rioted while protected by democrat mayors and governors  the vanguard of these lawless rioters is antifa  a group of left wing extremist who attack their political opponents and police officers to advance their socialist agenda  despite antifa s obvious rioting  democrats like new york s  jerry nadler  pretends antifa doesn t even exist   q   there s violence around the whole country do you disavow the violence of antifa  a   that s a myth that s being spread only in a washington dc   so who are antifa  and why do democrats run cover for them  antifa has a dark history  as germany s weimar s republic collapsed in the 1930 s  extremists political groups fought in the streets to secure political power  one of the primary combatants was the communist party of germany  which founded a street fighting unit called  antifaschistische aktion   that s right  antifa was the communist para military street gang  after wwii  antifa found new life in the united states punk music scene in the late 80 s and 90 s  under the pretense of fighting neo nazi s and white supremacy these punk music bands joined with some young communist revolutionaries tied to the domestic terror group  weather underground  to form anti racist action or the ara  the ara has deep ties to the revolutionary communist groups including the may 19th communist organization  which was home to various prominent domestic terrorist  the group committed numerous bombings and robberies and endorsed communist take overs in latin america  a common theme to use in these groups was to use  anti racism  as a front to commit violent criminal acts much like antifa does  today s antifa are direct descendants of these domestic communist groups  in fact  members of these older groups joined forces in 2013 and founded  torchantifa  one of the largest networks of antifa groups in the united states  democrats embrace antifa  through large loose networks  like torchantifa  smaller groups of antifa radicals have staged violent attacks and riots with little accountability in these democrat ran cities  in fact  again  democrats have encouraged antifa as these terrorize cities such as berkeley  portland  minneapolis and kenosha  see for yourself   peaceful protest   from the 1930 s germany to today  antifa s goal has not changed  to instigate a violent  communist revolution  however  president trump  attorney general barr  the fbi and the department of homeland security are working to bring in end to antifa s control of the streets and restore law   order to our nation  the world has enough failed communist and we can not allow the radical left and their antifa street fighters  to transform the united states into another one	0
